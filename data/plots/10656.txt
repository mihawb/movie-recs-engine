On the run from the police and the dangerous henchmen of the powerful entrepreneur he has just robbed, the suave and eccentric thief, Fred, takes refuge in the vast subterranean system of the Parisian Métro. But, as Héléna, the millionaire's chic and supercilious wife, needs her stolen things back, Fred plunges himself deeper and deeper into an obscure secret world, where a self-sustaining enclave of outcasts and social pariahs, inevitably, become his new family.

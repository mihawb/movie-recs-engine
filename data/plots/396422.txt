Mr Samuel Mullins (Anthony LaPaglia) handcrafts wooden toys and dolls. He seems very happy with his wife Esther (Miranda Otto) and their daughter Bee (Samara Lee). That is, until Bee is quickly taken from them in a road accident. Some time later, the Mullinses open their old home to Sister Charlotte (Stephanie Sigman) and a handful of young girls from an orphanage, in particular a wheelchair/crutch-bound girl named Janice (Talitha Bateman). By this time, Mrs. Mullins has been bedridden with a "condition" and Mr. Mullins appears quiet and withdrawn. Janice doesn't do as she's told, which is to stay away from one locked bedroom; something draws her to enter this room and look around. It was Bee Mullins' room. Led by what appears to be Bee's ghost, Janice finds the doll: Annabelle. Immediately, strange things start happening in the house. The young girls start experiencing things first. Janice's closest friend Linda (Lulu Wilson) is the first one to figure out what's happening, and mentions it to Mr. Mullins. Things quickly escalate. Linda manages to get Sister Charlotte to understand the root of the problems so far--the doll--and she confronts Mrs. Mullins. The Mullinses appear to know and understand what's going on, hinting it's been dealt with before, but it's not enough to save them all this time.â€”Margi_P

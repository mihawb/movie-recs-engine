Set in 1930s London, this movie tells the tale of orphans Pauline (Emma Watson), Petrova (Yasmin Paige), and Posy Fossil (Lucy Boynton), who are adopted by their Great-Uncle Matthew, an eccentric explorer (Richard Griffiths), and raised as sisters by his selfless niece, Sylvia Brown (Emilia Fox). The story revolves around each girl's struggle to fulfill her dreams: Pauline longs to be an actress, Petrova yearns to be an aviator, and Posy seems born to be a ballerina. But when Great-Uncle Matthew disappears, the money runs out--and the girls have a fight on their hands. They struggle to balance personal ambition with the need to survive physically, emotionally, and financially.â€”BBC Press Office

Nebraska, 1854. As the cold, snowy chill begins to settle, Mary Bee Cuddy, an independent, lonely yet strong-willed former teacher, undertakes to escort three women suffering from prairie madness to Lady's Aid Society Methodist Church, Hebron, Iowa. As Mary embarks on a long, challenging, and peril-laden journey, an unexpected ally in the shape of a claim jumper crosses paths with her: rugged George Briggs. However, whatever may be their fate, nothing will ever be the same again. What will it take to reach Altha Carter, the compassionate wife of the church's reverend?â€”Nick Riganas

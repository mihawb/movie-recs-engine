All one's life is recorded - to make it easier for the prosecutor and your defence representative at Judgement City to access a few episodes to show whether you made the most of the life you just completed. If you hadn't, you're sent back - to try again, until you do get it right. If you've succeeded, you'll move onward - you'll evolve to becoming a 'bigger-brained' being... somewhere. Middle aged Daniel dies in a car crash in the new BMW he'd bought for his birthday. He meets Julia who's also recently died. The 2 begin a courtship and FFA all in love, whilst defending their lives.â€”Dale O'Connor <daleoc@interaccess.com>

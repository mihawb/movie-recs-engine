After spending the night with beautiful Perri, young Carter, a New York City graphic designer, heads home to feed his dog, Jeter. Instead, Carter finds himself trapped in a perpetual time loop, always waking up next to Perri after a deadly encounter with Officer Merk. Determined to get to the bottom of his recurring nightmare, perplexed Carter tries every trick in the book, only to realise that he keeps reliving the same day over and over again. But Carter only wants to return home. Is it possible to outsmart fate?â€”Nick Riganas

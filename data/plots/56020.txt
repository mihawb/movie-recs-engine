It is the evening of June 20, 1993: Bruno Iori, the deejay of Radiofreccia, at the dawn of the eighteenth anniversary of its foundation, decides to close it for a reason that will make us understand, recalling, before closing, the past years, starting right from the episodes which led to the creation of what was once Radio Raptus. The long flashback starts in 1975, in a small town in the Reggio area (never explicitly named, even if some visual elements identify it with Correggio, the native village of Ligabue).
Due to the disappointment after the founding of radio Raptus, the life of Bruno's friends, even with jokes, outings, evenings at Adolfo's bar, will not be easy at all. Tito, no longer with the happiness brought by radio Raptus, will try to kill his father discovered that, long before the founding of the radio, he was abusing his younger sister. Hyena marries a rather libertine woman who, for this reason, will betray him with Boris (who is therefore marginalized by the rest of the group) on the same day of the wedding, during the reception.
The worst fate, however, will be up to Freccia, who will fall into drug addiction due to his relationship with a heroin addict girl. His addiction will cause him to lose his job and cause him several frictions with his friends, and especially with Bruno (who is the only one who has not been overwhelmed by the involution of his radio), and will cause him a lot of trouble with his radio. justice. Marzia's love will make him recover and, suffering for days due to the withdrawal crisis, he manages to get out of the drug tunnel and manages to stay out of it for months, but the betrayal by Marzia herself and then the disappointment of love also with Cristina (the cousin of Iena's wife) will make him fall back fatally in drugs and, therefore, will lead him to suicide. After his death, Radio Raptus will be renamed, in his honor, Radiofreccia.

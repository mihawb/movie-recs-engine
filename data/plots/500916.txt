The hunter Frank Walsh captures and steals wild animals from the Floresta Amazônica and smuggles them in a ship. Meanwhile, an American agency brings the skilled agent Richard Loffler, who was trained to be an assassin, together with a security team and a doctor to be transported to the USA in the same vessel. Along the journey, Loffler escapes and releases the animals to bring chaos on board.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

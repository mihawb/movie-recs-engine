In the small village of Taperoá, in the arid and remote badlands of the State of Paraíba, João Grilo and Chicó, two very poor Northeasterners, walk down the streets announcing "The Passion of the Christ", the greatest movie of the world. The session is a success, they make a few coins, but the struggle for survival goes on. João Grilo and Chicó draft many plans to make some money. New challenges come up, leading to more confusion caused by João Grilo's cleverness, always with Chicó. But the arrival of the beautiful Rosinha, the daughter of Antonio Moraes, raises the passion in Chicó and the jealousy of corporal Setenta. The plans of the duo, involving Chicó and Rosinha's marriage and the possession of a pig made of clay filled with money, are interrupted by the arrival of the "cangaceiro", an outlaw, Severino and the death of João Grilo. All the dead people meet again on the Last Judgment, when they will be all judged at the Soul Court by a black Jesus and by the devil. Each one's destiny will be decided by the apparition of Our Lady, the Compadecida with an unexpected ending, especially for João Grilo.

Near the end of the 19th century, in a wandering circus somewhere in Northern France, Rafael Padilla, an illegal Cuban immigrant working as a performer, accepts a partnership with the famous, yet declining white clown and acrobat George Footit to be his sidekick and renew his old numbers. Before long, the ambitious duo Footit and Chocolat will conquer Paris of the Belle Époque, taking by surprise the well-bred and demanding Parisian audience with their exuberance and originality which revolutionised the stagnant circus acts. Unfortunately though, with great success and fame come great problems, and Chocolat who was always under the shroud of prejudice and racial discrimination will sadly lose everything for the sake of ambition and artistic exploration.—Nick Riganas

Evelyn Couch is a middle-aged woman in her 40's, trying to find purpose in her life, while also struggling to find a way to save her marriage to her husband Ed.One day, the couple go to a nursing home in Alabama to visit Ed's Aunt Vesta. However, she angrily rebukes Evelyn, who wanders around the home, and encounters a woman named Ninny Threadgoode. Ninny claims she's visiting an acquaintance named Mrs Otis, and staying at the home with her, until her friend gets settled.Ninny then begins to speak of a family member named Idgie Threadgoode, the youngest child of the family she married into.Ninny tells about Idgie being the youngest and somewhat problematic of the Threadgoodes, but who could often be quelled by her older brother Buddy.One person whom Buddy has his eyes on, is Ruth Jamison, a friend of the family.However, tragedy strikes when on the wedding day of Idgie's older sister Leona, Buddy goes chasing after Ruth's hat that has been blown away. He catches it but gets his foot stuck in the nearby railroad tracks, and is unable to get away before he is killed by a train coming down the tracks.The death of Buddy pushes Idgie further away from those around her, and it is only the family's African-American friend Big George that she allows near.Following her first encounter with Ninny, Evelyn and Ed return during Halloween, and Evelyn encounters Ninny again, claiming she's visiting her friend Mrs Otis again.As Evelyn offers her some food, Ninny claims how she could go for some fried green tomatoes, like the kind that Idgie and Ruth made at the Whistle Stop Cafe, which leads her back to talking about Idgie.Years have passed since Buddy's death, but Idgie hasn't changed much, except for being aloof and causing a little ruckus here and there.This leads to Idgie's mother requesting Ruth Jamison stay with the family over the summer, while she helps at the church.Ruth tries to bring some order to Idgie's way of life, but Idgie soon ends up leading the straight-laced young woman on some wild shenanigans. From a place called The River Club, to throwing food from a train to hobos. Ruth is even surprised when Idgie procures her a fresh honeycomb from a beehive, proclaiming Idgie to be "a bee charmer."As the summer winds down, the two have grown closer, and Idgie throws Ruth a surprise birthday party down at The River Club, where they play poker, baseball, and share a quiet moment together. However, Idgie gets somewhat quiet when Ruth claims that when she goes home to Georgia after the summer, she's getting married to Frank Bennett.Though she is invited to the wedding, Idgie doesn't show, but watches from afar as Ruth and her husband move into their new home.Following her meeting with Ninny, Evelyn continues to go to a class to save her marriage, but she is also frustrated by her husband's lack of wanting to do anything.Eventually, Ed's Aunt Vesta doesn't want them visiting anymore, but Evelyn returns to the home to see Ninny around Christmas.Ninny then continues the story, telling how Idgie eventually returned to Ruth's house to see her...only to find that Frank had been abusing her. Idgie wants to fight Frank, but Ruth requests that Idgie leave.Eventually, Idgie and her family receive word that Frank's mother has died, and Idgie, her brother Julian, and Big George accompany her to Georgia to liberate Ruth.Idgie soon learns her friend is pregnant, but they are unable to make a quick getaway before Pete shows up, and tries to stop them.The group manages to get Ruth out, but not before Idgie tells Frank that she'll kill him if he touches Ruth again.As they ride off, Idgie triumphantly shouts: "Towanda!"Following this meeting, Evelyn suffers a drop in self-esteem when she is called a "fat cow" by a young man.Seeking solace from Ninny, Evelyn admits that she has an eating problem, and just feels confused and on edge. Ninny claims she's just going through "the change," and recommends Evelyn take steps to change her life around.Talk then returns to Idgie, who is overjoyed when Ruth has her baby, whom she names Buddy Jr.The two women then open The Whistle Stop Cafe, serving patrons inside, and African-American people as well, a practice that they are quietly criticized for by the local Sheriff, Grady Kilgore.Ruth even bestows some extra kindness on an old hobo named Smokey Lonesome, and the quiet man takes a shine to her.Unknown to Ruth, Frank has been quietly staking out where she lives. One evening, he enters Ruth's house to see his son. Though he fends off Ruth and their friend Sipsey's attacks, Frank leaves with the promise to return.Meanwhile, Grady and Idgie are having a conversation at the Whistle Stop, when a bullet is fired through the window, and Idgie sees that a KKK group is outside, whipping Big George.The group eventually leaves and Idgie tends to George, but Grady is fairly certain the Klansmen they encountered are not local.It soon turns out the men Idgie and George encountered were meant as a distraction, when Ruth and Sipsey tell about their encounter with Frank.Ninny then goes on to say that Frank did return later on one evening, during a production of the Town Follies show that Idgie and Grady performed in. However, during a lull in the performance, Big George demands Idgie come quickly.The story then cuts to some time after that night, when Grady brings by Sheriff Curtis Smoote, who has come from Georgia after Frank Bennett has been reported missing.Ruth tries to tempt Smoote with some pie, but he settles for some barbecue (of which he consumes quite a bit).Smoote claims that Idgie is a prime suspect, given a hired man of Frank's heard her threaten to kill him, but with no proof, the Sheriff just makes idle threats and leaves.After the encounter, Ruth is suspicious of Idgie, given her friend won't tell where she was on the night she left the Town Follies. Idgie simply promises Ruth that her former husband won't be bothering her anymore.After the story, Evelyn begins to change her ways. When some teenagers steal a parking space, she yells out "Towanda," and blatantly smashes into their car. She also begins to exercise and eat healthier, and is in much better spirits when next she meets with Ninny.Ninny then continues the story. Shortly after Frank disappeared, so too did Smokey Lonesome, but five years later, he returned to the Whistle Stop.However, Smokey hasn't been long in town before Buddy Jr is injured while playing around the railroad tracks. Luckily, unlike his namesake who perished by a train, Buddy Jr just loses his left arm (which they hold a funeral for).Shortly afterwards, heavy rains flood the town, and in the nearby river, Frank Bennett's truck is found.Sheriff Smoote isn't far behind, and has Grady arrest Idgie and Big George for murder. Grady does offer Idgie the chance to leave town and have George take the blame, but she refuses.The two are eventually taken to Georgia and put on trial. The case takes a major turn when the Reverend Herbert Scroggins, claims that Idgie and Big George were at the Baptist Revival for 3 days, providing them with an alibi.Upon hearing this information, the judge dismisses the case. Unknown to many there, the Reverend lied (thanks to some promises by Ruth that Idgie would attend church).Back in the present day, Evelyn begins to tear down a wall in the house, leading to her having a conversation with her husband about her feelings towards him, and how she's been trying to save their marriage.When next Evelyn returns to the nursing home, she meets Mrs Otis' daughter-in-law, Sue. Sue also explains that unknown to Ninny, her house has been condemned and was torn down.Evelyn hides this from Ninny when she meets her, throwing her a little Birthday Party, and giving her some fried green tomatoes she made herself.Ninny then recalls how after the trial, it was found out that Ruth had cancer.Idgie moved her to the family home and Sipsey watched over Ruth as she grew weaker.Ruth requests Idgie watch over Buddy Jr, and in her final moments, asks her friend to tell her a story.Idgie gives in, and tells a story that Buddy had told them long ago, about ducks that froze in a lake, and carried it away.Sometime afterward back in the present day, Ed finds Evelyn rebuilding the wall she knocked down. Bringing her flowers, he apologizes for his attitude, but balks when Evelyn claims she wants to bring Ninny to live with them.Despite Ed's misgivings, Evelyn is determined and goes to the nursing home. However, she finds a nurse in Ninny's room taking stuff down, saying the occupant of the room died.Evelyn nearly freaks out, until she learns that it was Mrs Otis who died. As Ninny was just staying for Mrs Otis, she packed her things and went home.Remembering what Mrs Otis' daughter-in-law told her, Evelyn drives to Ninny's place, and finds the old woman heartbroken that her home has been torn down.Evelyn cheers the old woman up, telling how she has helped her turn her life around, and is willing to let her stay with her and Ed.It is then that Ninny reveals that Mrs Otis was Sipsey's baby sister, and Ninny then tells Evelyn what happened on the night that Frank Bennett disappeared.Frank had come back to town to take back his son, but was confronted by Smokey Lonesome. However, it was Sipsy who knocked Frank over the head with a frying pan, killing him just as Big George and Idgie come upon the scene.Idgie and the group hold a small meeting that night to decide what to do. Even with a claim of self-defense and Smokey as a witness, the group figures a jury would never believe Sipsey.To protect her, Smokey leaves town, and George cuts up the body under the guise of preparing meat for a barbecue...the same barbecue that Sheriff Smoote ate four plates of when he came around looking for Frank!Evelyn can't quite believe the story, but as she and Ninny walk past a small cemetery, they find Ruth's gravestone, and a fresh honeycomb in a jar with a note next to it...from Idgie.Ninny claims she's still around, and the two women head back to Evelyn's car.In a closing narration, Ninny tells that after Ruth died and the train stopped coming through town, the Whistle Stop Cafe closed, and much of the area followed soon after. She remarks how the little place brought so many people together.

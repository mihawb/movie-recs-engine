Dr Susan Wheeler is devastated when her best friend is pronounced brain dead after minor surgery at her hospital. Looking at the records, Susan finds that over the previous year a number of other fit young people have ended up the same way.

She continues to investigate increasingly alone, starting to wonder if she can trust even her own boyfriend.â€”J-26

The story of Greg Heffley, a middle-school scrawny boy with an unlimited ambition to be famous when he's older and an overactive imagination. In contrast to Greg, his best friend Rowley just breezes through life without any hardship and just seems to be successful without too much effort. In his journal, we get a first-person perspective into Greg's hilariously eventful life, and his out-of-the-box thoughts and ideas. In time, our little protagonist learns to appreciate his real friends and the satisfaction of doing what is right.

Young Louis Drax is a survivor: he has escaped from death eight times. On his ninth birthday, he goes on a picnic with his beautiful mother Natalie and his father Peter near a cliff. Out of the blue, Louis falls off the cliff and doctors declare him dead. However, he awakens just before the autopsy and stays in a coma under the care of Dr. Allan Pascal. Natalie discloses to the police detective Dalton that Peter, who is missing, pushed Louis off the cliff and he becomes the prime suspect of the case. Meanwhile, Dr. Pascal, who is married, becomes close to Natalie. When weird things happen in the hospital with Louis, Dr. Pascal invites his psychiatrist Dr. Perez to share his knowledge about the behavior of the boy and they disclose secrets about the Drax family.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

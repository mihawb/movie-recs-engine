In the rife with evidence house of a brutally murdered couple, the Forensic crew find the body of an almost intact and exceptionally preserved young woman in her mid-twenties. Amid a huge media frenzy, Sheriff Sheldon enlists the help of the experienced coroner, Tommy Tilden, and his son, Austin, entrusting them with the emergency autopsy of this beautiful Jane Doe with the cloudy eyes. In high hopes of finishing early, Austin decides to stay with his father during the seemingly quiet night; however, the peat under the cryptic woman's fingernails, the severed tongue, and her completely shattered joints strongly imply that this will not be just another ordinary case. Without delay, the two coroners begin to work, only to plunge themselves deeper and deeper into a world of impossible occurrences and equally inexplicable findings. Then, in the dead of night, something eerily strange happens. Can they unearth pale Jane's morbid secret?â€”Nick Riganas

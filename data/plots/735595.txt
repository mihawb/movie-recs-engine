Hendrik is sixteen, a big city kid, and vexed to learn that his mother is moving with him and his little brother Eddi to a village in the south of Austria. To make matters worse, the locals shun the new rustic family home. They say it has been haunted ever since a mother poisoned her two sons in there many decades ago. When a sleep- walking Eddi starts carving strange symbols into the walls, Hendrik and his friends set off on a quest to lift the secret of the spooky house.

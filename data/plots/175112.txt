Mesmerised by the sparkling Blue Pixie Dust and thrilled by its magical power, the inquisitive and ambitious dust-keeper fairy, Zarina, finds herself neck-deep into trouble when she starts experimenting with the mystical powder. Almost one year later and far away from the colourful Pixie Hollow, Zarina is now a pirate-fairy and a member of Skull Rock's intimidating corsairs, unbeknownst to her that Tinker Bell and her loyal friends--Silvermist, Iridessa, Fawn, Vidia, and Rosetta--have set off to find her. Now, with an unforeseen change of talents, can the little sprites outsmart the young cabin boy, James Hook, and the rest of the crew?â€”Nick Riganas

Giacomo (Fabio De Luigi) is a great heir of industrial, but he prefers to devote his mind to thoughts and fantasies. An esoteric will change Giacomo's life by telling him that he identified the current reincarnation of his father, who died when he was a young boy. The reincarnation is Mario Pitagora (Elio Germano), a man with the sole interest in money. Their meeting will change their lifes.

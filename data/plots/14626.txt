This film focuses on ex-Foreign Legion officer Galoup as he recalls his once-glorious life of leading troops in the Gulf of Djibouti. His existence there was happy, strict, and regimented, but the arrival of promising young recruit Sentain plants the seeds of jealousy in Galoup's mind. He feels compelled to stop him from coming to the attention of the commandant he admires, but who ignores him. Ultimately, his jealousy leads to the destruction of both Sentain and himself.â€”L.H.

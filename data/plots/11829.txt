Having no other choice in front of their father's deathbed, the rivalling and mutually abusive twin siblings, Trinità and Bambino, are forced to make a reluctant promise: to always work in unison to become good bandits. With this in mind, Bambino will attempt to show the tricks of the trade to his good-for-nothing brother with the lightning-fast right hand; however, it seems that Trinità is only interested in beans and charming, but naive, blue-eyed ladies.

In present-day New York, a young man believes he is Don Juan, aware of where he is and that this is the 20th century. Regardless of the validity of his claim, he is able to seduce women in his complete conviction of who he is. He becomes under the psychiatric care of soon-to-be retired Dr. Jack Mickler at Woodhaven State Hospital when he becomes suicidal over losing whom he believes is the love of his life, Doña Ana. Don Juan believes that Jack is nobleman Don Octavio de Flores. As Jack tries to convince him that he is not Don Juan in what are Jack's final 10 days of practice, the two come to an agreement that Don will do whatever Jack says, including being medicated and possibly being committed, once Don cannot convince Jack of who he says he is. As Don tells Jack his story, Jack eventually meets people who purportedly know Don and provide Jack conflicting stories both to each other and to Don's account of his life. Beyond what Don tells him, what Jack decides to do is influenced by the pressure he is receiving from the hospital's chief of staff, Dr. Paul Showalter, not to confirm the notion of Jack having chosen his work over these last few years of his practice, and the type of retirement life he wants with his wife of 32 years, Marilyn Mickler.—Huggo

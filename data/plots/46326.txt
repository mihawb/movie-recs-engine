In high hopes of wiping the slate clean, Jean, a taciturn deserter from the French Colonial Army, ends up in the fog-covered port city of Le Havre. Like a fish out of water, Jean holes himself up in a remote bar at the far edge of the harbour, until he finds a new set of clothes and a new identity to catch the next ship to Venezuela. But, there, a chance encounter with the delicate seventeen-year-old woman, Nelly, will drag Jean into a dangerous world of aspiring gangsters and shady merchants, putting in jeopardy his sweet dream of a better life. Now, smitten by beautiful Nelly, Jean has his back to the wall. Is love the ultimate prize?â€”Nick Riganas

After a painful break up with his first girlfriend Suzy (Michelle Ryan), Ben Willis (Sean Biggerstaff), an aspiring artist, develops insomnia. To take his mind off his problem he spends his nights working at a local supermarket, where he meets colorful characters. He falls in love with his colleague Sharon Pintey (Emilia Fox).He lets his imagination run wild. In particular, he imagines that he can stop time for others, so that he can walk around in a world that is "frozen" like in pause mode of a film. He imagines female patrons standing frozen in the supermarket, so that he can undress and draw them.We see in flashback, with Ben's voice-over explaining how he always has been impressed by the beauty of the female body, how he, as a young boy, could see a Swedish boarder naked while she was going to and coming from the shower (we are told that, being Swedish, she did not believe this situation required modesty). Also we see little Ben's friend Sean Higgins (Shaun Evans) showing Ben his parents' adult magazines.Sharon is Ben's date when they go to the birthday party of their boss. Ben meets Suzy who wants to continue their relationship. Ben refuses, but Sharon gets a negative impression seeing Ben with Suzy for a moment, and gets angry.As a practical joke colleagues Barry Brickman (Michael Dixon) and Matt Stephens (Michael Lambourne) phone him, one of them pretending to be an art gallery owner who is interested in his drawings, and an appointment is made. It turns out well: the gallery owner, seeing Ben's work, is interested, and an exhibition follows. Sharon also visits it and is impressed not only by Ben's success, but also by the many paintings portraying her; ceasing to be angry with him.

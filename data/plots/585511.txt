Plagued by bad luck all her life, 18-year-old Sam, a bright-eyed orphan brought up in the care system, is about to enter the real world and move into her new house. And as she bids farewell to her best friend and roommate Hazel, Sam is officially on her own. But it's a jungle out there, especially when you are the unluckiest person in the world. However, as Sam tries to find her feet, preoccupied with doing the right thing, change arrives in the shape of a mysterious black cat and a shiny lucky penny. Now, the sky's the limit. But first things first. Where does luck come from? If Bad Luck is a mirror image of Good Luck, is Sam about to embark on the adventure of a lifetime?â€”Nick Riganas

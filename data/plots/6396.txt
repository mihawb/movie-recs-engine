Stevo and Heroin Bob are two typical average anarchist punks of the kind that could be seen all over New York City or the UK in the early-to-mid-1980s. These two, however, live in the most religiously-oppressive place in America: Salt Lake City, Utah; so they are viewed as and treated like aliens or devil worshippers by all the local "rednecks". After they graduate college in 1985, they decide that the only way to rebel against the system is to do nothing, waste their educated minds, and keep the party going. But with his dad hounding him to go to Harvard Law, Heroin Bob getting a girlfriend, and a growing doubt in his belief system, Stevo can't help but feel that the good times could be over and it's time to move on. But what if moving on proves the one thing he's not ready to know: that he might just be a poser after all?.â€”T.S. Abupabup

Based on the "Nurse Matilda" books by Christianna Brand comes the story of Nanny McPhee (Dame Emma Thompson). Mr. Cedric Brown (Colin Firth) is now a widower with seven ill-behaved children who've already chased away seventeen nannies. But when a mysterious voice tells Cedric to hire Nanny McPhee, she arrives at the Brown home and the kids learn to behave properly. But when great Aunt Adelaide (Dame Angela Lansbury) tells Cedric he must be married by the end of the month or she'll separate the children, he tries to find women, but the children run them off, and Nanny McPhee tells Simon, the eldest, that he will face the consequences, so the kids go to Selma quickly and admit what they did and ask to give their father a second chance and they will be married. Will the kids really find the perfect woman for their father?â€”Max Davison <RockyHexorcist2785>

Michael "Jay" Cochran has just left the Navy after 12 years. He's not quite sure what he will do now, except that he knows that he wants a holiday. He decides to visit Tiburon Mendez, a powerful but shady Mexican businessman whom he once flew to Alaska for a hunting trip. Arriving at the Mendez mansion in Mexico, he is immediately surprised by the beauty and youth of Mendez's wife Miryea. Their attraction to each other is undeniable, but Cochran is aware that Mendez is a powerful, vindictive, and very possessive man who does not tolerate betrayal.â€”Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au>

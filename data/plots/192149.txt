Adventurer Rydal, Stanford-graduated rebel son of an archaeology professor, earns his living as Greek-speaking guide to foreign tourist with some side scams using his charms. In 1962 his latest arks are cynical US businessman Chester MacFarland and his foxy wife Colette, who has an instant crush on handsome Rydal, and vice-versa. Returning to their hotel a bracelet she probably left in the taxi as an excuse, Rydal bumps into Chester disposing of the corpse of Paul Vittorio , the Yankee P.E. sent by his mobster clients to recuperate the fortune he lost with incompetent 'safe investments', an agrees to help them escape, without 'worrying' Colette', even after learning the creep didn't faint but was killed in a fight. Trough a friend he arranges for fake passports to be delivered in Crete, where she becomes his mistress after learning the truth and jealous Chester leaves Rydal unconscious near the accidentally death-fallen Collette. Both escape from Greece as involuntary allies but the truth catches up, with the police, in Istanbul.â€”KGF Vissers

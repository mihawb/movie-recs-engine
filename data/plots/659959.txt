In long flashbacks, cute gay Normandy seaside resort schoolboy Alexis 'Alex' Robin (16) tells how he got arrested in 1985 for grave violation. Getting in trouble at sea sailing mate Chris's boat alone, he was rescued by handsome elder David Gorman (18), immediately made friends and soon became intimate, while David's widowed mother eagerly hired him in their beach shop, while they secretly make love. But David, who insisted on a morbid-romantic 'pact' the surviving mate must dance o the first-died's grave, constantly seeks new experiences, while Alex gets jealous and possessive, feeling cheated when David openly flirts with English girl Kate. A row and motorbike chase see David crash fatally, crushing Alexi's and his mother's hearts. Literature teacher Lefèvre gets Alexis, who gets arrested for keeping the pact after a morgue incident, to write his trauma down, being gifted for essays, so the social worker can build a defense in court.—KGF Vissers

Adán (Omar Chaparro) is a charming seducer who believes he knows how to make any woman swoon. He prepares to teach his friends the art of conquering women, using his array of bullet-proof rules of seduction. Mia (Martha Higareda) is an ambitious producer who dreams of having her own TV show on women empowerment called "Todos Caen," a strategic guide to dating that teaches you just how to hook a man--and have him eating out of your hand in no time. Mia and Adán cross paths at a bar one fateful night, and from there the game is on in an all-out battle of the sexes. But as they test their finely-honed seduction strategies on each other, both find that sometimes the more you play hard to get, the harder you may end up falling.—Pantelion Films

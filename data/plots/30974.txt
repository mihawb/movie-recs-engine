Chloe, Lou, Fred, Anton & Karen set out on a rock climbing adventure in an unathorised area in the French Alps. But what starts out as fun soon turns into a battle for their lives.
This movie had potential but takes too long to sort out what genre its trying to belong to - an action? A Thriller? Or a slasher? Worth a look.

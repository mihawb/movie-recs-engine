In May 2022, only three years after the events of Blade Runner (1982), the new and improved Nexus-8 replicants of the powerful Tyrell Corporation have set in motion the violent human supremacy movement, causing a public backlash against the human-like synthetics. As the combat humanoid, Iggy Cygnus, saves the female replicant, Trixie, from certain death, he hatches a bold and dangerous plan to even the odds and ensure the future of the androids; however, with such a devastating weapon in their possession, the very lives of humans and replicants alike are at stake. Will there be a future after the Los Angeles 2022 blackout?â€”Nick Riganas

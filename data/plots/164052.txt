The Johnsons are an attractive upper-middle-class family. Sidney, the husband and father, is a famous poet, known and adored for his kindness and sensitivity. Joan, the wife and mother, is an obsessive homemaker and the life of every party. Their son Isaiah is a charismatic young man who has just married an equally-appealing young woman. In fact, only thing separates the Johnsons from their charming friends and neighbors: Isaiah, the son, has been molesting Sidney, the father, since he was 12 years old. What's more, Sidney has written a memoir that chronicles, in great detail, the ins and outs of this unseemly father-son relationship. Will the manuscript ever see the light of day, or will young Isaiah have a thing or two to say about it? "The Strange Thing About the Johnsons" is a dark satire of the domestic melodrama; it asks "What if...?" then, for some reason, comes up with an answer.â€”Anonymous

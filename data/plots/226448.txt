A young Rebecca Porter is about to go sledding in New Hampshire, while across the country in New Mexico, a young Dylan Kershaw is at school with a group of his friends. Suddenly, without even knowing what is happening or why, Dylan is able to experience everything that Rebecca experiences, and at the exact moment that Rebecca crashes her sled, rendering her unconscious, Dylan is thrown from his desk and is knocked out. Twenty years later, Rebecca (Zoe Kazan) is married to a successful doctor, Phillip Porter (Mark Feuerstein), while Dylan (Michael Stahl-David) has just recently gotten out of prison. One night, Rebecca attends a dinner party with her husband, and Dylan is at a local bar trying to stay out of trouble.

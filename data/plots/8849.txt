This is a remake of the 1966 film with Michael Caine as Alfie. Jude Law now plays the title role of Alfie. The film uses the same speaking technique as the original, with Alfie talking directly to the camera when he is talking about women. The audience gets the inside information on women, as if we were part of the show. Alfie is from England living in Manhattan, working as a limousine driver. Alfie wants to some day own the limo business, but right now he is chauffeuring the rich around town, and sometimes making love to the lonely female passengers in the backseat of the limo. Alfie is very charming to women and knows what they want to hear. Alfie's goal is to make love to as many beautiful women as he can with no commitment or responsibilities, before he finds his soulmate. But Alfie finds that life is not that simple, and he will have to take responsibility for his actions. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)

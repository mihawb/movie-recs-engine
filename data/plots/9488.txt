Young agents Carmen and Juni Cortez are now full fledged spies at the OSS agency but only as Level 2 agents. When a top secret, all powerful device is stolen, the brother sister duo set out to retrieve it. Their mission takes them to an uncharted island where they must take on a duo of rival Spy Kids and a horde of strange monsters. Only then the Cortezes realize that their mission is all a set up to lure them into a trap. And little do they know is that their parents are also on their tail.â€”Blazer346

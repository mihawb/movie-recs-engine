This is the summer when young Lucy, a 19-year-old American, has decided to lose her virginity. For the summer holidays, she arrives in a beautiful place in Tuscany, a villa on a hilltop owned by an English artist, where she discovers different interesting people of different age at different stages of life, of different commitment, understanding, and sexuality.Her dead mother left Lucy her diary which points out she was conceived on this very hilltop, but doesnt say who her father is; Lucy has to find out.Lucy also wants to give herself to the young Italian, Nicolo, who kissed her four years ago, but she discovers that life is not always what you have decided, especialy when love is concerned, it is not that simple, but it is beautiful. She takes in all this beauty. We all steal beauty from the world. We need it as we live, as we create (the object of the artist, or creating life), as we comply to life, as one's loses one's virginity.Life feeds on stealing beauty, before becoming beauty itself. Lucy has grown up.

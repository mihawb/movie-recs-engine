Isle of Inisherin, Ireland, April 1923. They say all good things must come to an end. And unable to believe his ears, Pádraic, a good-natured dairy farmer living with his unmarried sister Siobhán, has no choice but to swallow his pride and deal with the sudden, bitter, irreversible reality: his closest friend Colm wants nothing to do with him anymore. But with adamant Colm determined never to speak with his former bosom buddy for the rest of his life, confused Pádraic teeters on the brink of collapse, trying to figure out what he did wrong. Meanwhile, as Colm gives Pádraic the cold shoulder and the silent treatment, pressing questions arise. Why has Colm so abruptly cut off his lifelong friend? In the end, what triggered Colm's unpredictable behavioural shift?—Nick Riganas

As Princess Odette and Prince Derek are about to celebrate the first anniversary of their wedding, their anniversary plans are interrupted by the actions of Sir Knuckles. Sir Clavius, an evil magician who used to be allies with the sorcerer from the first film, Lord Rothbart, plans on conquering the world by stealing a magic orb, so he kidnaps Derek's mother, Queen Uberta and held her hostage at Castle Mountain. Now it's up to Odette, Derek, Jean Bob, General Puffin, and Speed to rescue Uberta and thwart Clavius' plans.â€”matthewhedrich

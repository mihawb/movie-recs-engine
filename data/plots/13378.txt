DONALD DUCK is in a murderous mood, even worse after the misbehaved boys mess up his Christmas Eve plans and expose him in front of daisy. Fearing they got off Santa's Christmas list, they figure making up at home in time is more hopeless then sending themselves to the North Pole. There they sneak in to put their names on the list, but semi-accidentally wreck the smooth industrial-scale preparations, then make up. PLUTO wrecks MICKEY's excessively elaborate Christmas party preparations and is literally sent to the dog house, but runs away. The search for him and home, with lots of semi-voluntary helps from Santa's sled reindeer, fixes things. GOOFY's son Max is now in college and embarrassed about his clumsy, over-protective father, who doesn't seem able to follow instructions to behave respectably when he brings home his dorm date Mona but she finds both adorable anyway.â€”KGF Vissers

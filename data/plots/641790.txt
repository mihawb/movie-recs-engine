In Puerto Rico, waitress Madison Taylor is working the night shift when she witnesses the brutal murder of a police detective by two men and is hit on the thigh. Lt. Steve Wakes, who was the partner of the murdered detective, takes Madison to a nearby hospital in an attempt to remove the bullet needed to identify the killers. However, Madison needs to spend the night in the hospital and is moved to an empty floor under the protection of a security guard. But the two killers turn out to be a pair of corrupt cops and they will do anything to kill Madison and recover the bullet.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

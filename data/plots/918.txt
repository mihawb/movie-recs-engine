Conscientious employee Walter Davis is willing to go the extra mile to ensure that he will nail his next presentation. With this in mind, unsociable Walter works night and day crunching numbers, only to realise that his uneventful life will always stand in the way of success unless he finds the perfect escort to take to the company's make-or-break dinner.

And to think that sweet Nadia seemed such a nice person. But can one blind date ruin one's life entirely?â€”Nick Riganas

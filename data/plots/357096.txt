Living under a new identity, Jennifer Hills, now called Angela, the resilient survivor of sexual assault and abuse in I Spit on Your Grave (2010), struggles to bury the past, attending group therapy with other troubled fellow victims. However, recovery is a slow, challenging and painful process, and just when Jennifer started making friends and believing in herself, the violent murder of dear one by the hands of a perverted sadist will trap Hills, once more, in a furious maelstrom of destruction and gore. Now, there is no turning back, and those who made the innocents suffer will have to pay in blood. And Jennifer will spit on their graves again.â€”Nick Riganas

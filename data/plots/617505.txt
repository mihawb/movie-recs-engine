We join our story on the eve of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a city with a witch history. Our hero is the Fifty-Four year old Hubert Schubert Dubois, who despite being a kind, generous, and overall selfless individual is treated like the town idiot and constantly belittled and bullied by the residents whether it be in the form of malicious pranks or the near-constant barrage of items being thrown at him. Sweet Hubie is generally able to rise above their insulation, but Halloween can make things difficult as his fatal flaw is a proclivity for being frightened.The only Salemite, besides his Mother, that seems to appreciate our protagonist as a worthwhile individual is Violet Valentine. Awarded the superlatives of Most Friendly, Most Popular, and Best Looking (the High School Hat Trick) and despite having married and divorced local law enforcement officer Steve Downey, can't help but look at him with the same stars in her eyes she had when they were in first grade.Each year, in spite of his fear and this October Thirty-First God deciding to go with a Full Moon, Hubie still gears up with his self-made Swiss Army Thermos to fulfill the duties of his annual, self-appointed, role as Official Volunteer Halloween Helper teaching the children about door to door candy etiquette and acting as a safety monitor during the Halloween Festivities to help ensure that every citizen and tourist in Salem has a safe and happy Halloween. What Hubie doesn't know is that in addition to the everyday mischief that both children and adults are prone to get into on All Hallow's Eve. This year he will also have to contend with a Werewolf, an escaped Mental Patient, and an evil unknown presence abducting townsfolk.Richie Hartman sorts out two of the three explaining he only broke out of the mental institution to track down his roommate, the aforementioned werewolf. Thus, the only matter left is the missing citizens. At this time it is revealed that Hubie, was the last one to interact with each of them before they were taken and the citizens of Salem live up to their legacy and much like they accused his great-great-great-great-great-great grandmother of being a witch in the 1600's they are now accusing Hubie of foul play.Forced to run from the angry mob, Hubie takes shelter at the local radio station where he is recognized as their second most frequent caller, after the female who always calls to dedicate a song to her special someone, but just a few nights ago while under the influence of truth serum a.k.a. chardonnay, revealed the identity of their special someone as none other than Hubie.With this revelation there are only two possible suspects who could be responsible for the disappearances and it is up to Hubie to determine who could be holding them captive before they take their affections for him too far and end up doing something unspeakable to those who have victimized Hubie his entire life.

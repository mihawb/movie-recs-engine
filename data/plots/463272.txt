After confronting head-on the nefarious Vortex organization in Johnny English Reborn (2011), the retired and now-grizzled man of mystery who knows no fear, Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson), finds himself teaching geography and showing the ropes to his young pupils at a boarding school. However, with the annual G12 International Conference being just around the corner, the British Prime Minister (Dame Emma Thompson) will have no other choice but to call Johnny out of retirement when an all-out cyber-attack exposes the identities of every spy in the United Kingdom. Now, England's old-school counter-espionage tactics are up against the elaborate and well-orchestrated digital warfare unleashed by a sinister megalomaniac who craves world domination. Can Johnny English and his tech-savvy sidekick, Bough (Ben Miller), save the Queen and Great Britain?â€”Nick Riganas

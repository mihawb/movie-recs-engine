1965. After the end of segregation Dr. Martin Luther King receives Nobel Prize amidst the still heated south of the USA, with the then-recent church bombing that claimed five little girls' lives . Dr. King meets with President Lyndon Johnson, demanding him to act on black peoples' right to vote. When Johnson evades stating his war on poverty needs to take priority, Dr. King goes to Selma, Alabama where blacks are of more than fifty percent of population but are still restricted from voting. The white supremacists are embodied in the sheriff, Jim Clark. Dr. King says the movement needs drama to attract Johnson's attention. First they stand in front of the county registration, which ends in arrests. While Dr. King is in prison, his wife meets with Malcolm X, the leader of the other polar of the black movement. X tells her that his views of Dr. King has changed and he's willing to help, although in a harsh way.When Dr. King gets out of jail and is in Selma, an unofficial gathering happens at night that ends in violence as troopers disperse the crowds. A boy, Jimmy Lee Jackson, is killed in that incident. Soon the group decides to have a march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. The march ends in violence where the participants are bludgeoned and beaten and the images are captured on TV and in newspapers. Dr. King did not walk with them as it was expected to end in violence as a Johnson aide told them. He calls out to all people, blacks and whites to join the next march. Many people did come to join, even whites, most of them clergy. But when the march actually begins, despite Johnson's attempt to make a deal with Dr. King, the troopers withdraw from their guard. But Dr. King backs down from his march. That night a clergy member who participated on the march is beaten and killed. And the court grants the legality for the march. At last President Johnson sends the Congress a bill to end the voting restrictions.

Tired of being locked in a reptile house where humans gawk at them like they're monsters, a ragtag group of Australia's deadliest creatures plot a daring escape from their zoo to the Outback, a place where they'll fit in without being judged for their scales and fangs. Leading the group is Maddie, a poisonous snake with a heart of gold, who bands together with self-assured Thorny Devil Lizard Zoe, lovelorn hairy spider Frank, and sensitive scorpion Nigel. But when their nemesis Pretty Boy, a cute but obnoxious koala, unexpectedly joins their escape, Maddie and the gang have no choice but to take him with them. So begins a hair-raising and hilarious road trip across Australia, as they are pursued by zookeeper Chaz and his adventure-seeking mini-me.

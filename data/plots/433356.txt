In 1914, in Philadelphia, the wealthy and idealistic nurse Lillie Rowe learns in a lecture by Dr. Jude that there is an American medical mission founded by Dr. Garrett Woodruff in the countryside of the Ottoman Empire that needs donation. She decides to donate and deliver herself the truck that belonged to her deceased brother and medical supplies using her heritage. Upon arrival, she stumbles upon the Ottoman Lieutenant Ismail Veli that helps her to visit a mosque. Lillie is forced by the government to be escorted by Lieutenant Ismail to drive to the mission, and he is assigned to spy on the local Armenians. Lillie works in the hospital and falls in love with Ismail while Jude suffers from unrequited love. Meanwhile, World War I begins, and the mission is in the middle of the Ottoman Empire where the Russians are coming.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

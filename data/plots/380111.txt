The film The Crew( in English) is a disaster/survival aviation movie starring Russian actors and Russian contributors.
It has an introduction to the main characters, a pilot trainee, his pilot trainee girlfriend, an experienced pilot and a cast of great superiors and extras.
The film has a backdrop of morality and how 2 pilots decide to break rules to help save victims of a deadly earthquake by taking them on board. Of course disaster begins with one plane needing to move them to another..midair! With our personal look into main character's lives and struggles we begin to see transition in the characters and a moral code of helping refugees is the right thing to do.
There are nail biting moments, heroic moves and everyone seems to have come out of this for the better.
There is a particular touching scene with daddy pilot and his rebellious son that appears unsolvable and an understanding wife. Then there's the pilot trainee who is competing with his girlfriend who has more experience. The relationship is strained and doesn't look like it can mend.
The heroic move to pickup the refugees from an earthquake makes up for their choice to ignore helping refugees in war torn Africa, whom they watched get shot.
Against all odds this mission was both successful, unnerving and lost quite a few but nevertheless, many lives were saved by the impossible, never attempted rescue from one plane disabled into another with a short time frame to complete.
The camera has great angles that make this realistic even if scientifically, it may not have been. The intense acting by characters makes this movie believable and moves it along nicely.
The ending was a bit odd with everyone back in training but it had a feel good note to it.

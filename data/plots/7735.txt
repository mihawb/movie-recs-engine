When Rainer Wegner (JÃ¼rgen Vogel), a popular high school teacher, finds himself relegated to teaching autocracy, instead of anarchy, as part of the school's project week, he is less than enthusiastic. So are his students, who greet the prospect of studying fascism yet again with apathetic grumbling: The Nazis sucked. We get it. Struck by the teenagers complacency and unwitting arrogance, Rainer devises an unorthodox experiment. But his hastily conceived lesson in social orders and the power of unity soon grows a life of its own.

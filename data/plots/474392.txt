A narration tells us how the Hebrews had done wrong and were thus put in the hands of the brutal Philistines. The Philistines are collecting food from the Hebrews. In the back, Samson (Taylor James), a Hebrew from the tribe of Dan and his brother Caleb (Greg Kriek) are attempting to steal food while Samson is telling riddles. However, they get caught and are chased through the city by Philistine soldiers. In the meantime, Prince Rallah of the Philistines kills a Hebrew named Tobias (James Ryan) for asking for more food. When Samson and Caleb come home, his parents urge Samson to fight back against the Philistines since he was chosen to do so from birth. However, Samson prefers peace and is reluctant to do so.

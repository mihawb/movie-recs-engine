Set in the mysterious world of The Matrix (1999), The Animatrix, a collection of nine short animated films, offers an insight into the complex Matrix universe. 'The Second Renaissance, Parts I and II' chronicle the cataclysmic events that link the real world to the machine world. Then, 'Program' portrays the doubts of a skilled warrior toying with the idea of giving up the revolution against the machines. Following, 'World Record' depicts the efforts of a track athlete to set a new world record at all costs. In 'Kid's Story', a teenager combing the net for answers is contacted by Neo himself, and in 'Beyond', Yoko discovers more than she can handle about the Matrix while looking for her missing cat. In 'A Detective Story', a mysterious client hires Ash, a determined, Sam Spade-like private investigator, to track down a computer hacker named Trinity. In the next chapter named 'Matriculated', Resistance fighter Alexa and her rebels embark on a nearly impossible mission: can they convert robots to sympathise with the human race? Lastly, in the 'Final Flight of the Osiris', the crew of the ill-fated scout ship Osiris discovers multitudes of Sentinels boring down on Zion and a fierce battle to warn the inhabitants of the last human city commences.â€”Nick Riganas

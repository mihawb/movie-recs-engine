Ellen or Eli is a 20 year old woman suffering from anorexia nervosa. When her step mother & absent father run out of options, they manage to get an appointment with a very successful but unorthodox doctor. When Ellie accepts the help she's placed into a group home with other people suffering from eating disorders. Because she's with people just like her, Ellie finds herself facing the truth of her disease. Will she find herself before its too late or will death come knocking faster than expected?â€”Carrie DeCosta

Arvid is a regular bank clerk whose life changes radically when he knocks out bank robber Franz with his squash racket. A few days later, Franz's wife visits him lamenting that she needed the swag for an IVF. To obtain the money, Arvid and his criminal brother Harald plan a robbery, but it ends bloodily and drags them into real trouble.â€”Moritz Muehlenhoff <jmm@inutil.org>

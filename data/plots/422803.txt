There is something strange going on in the peaceful town of Mossingham, right after the fantastic rescue mission in Shaun the Sheep Movie (2015). As mischievous Shaun orders in pizza for the woolly flock under the nose of the Farmer, and Bitzer, the ever-watchful sheepdog, a mysterious, fast-moving UFO enters the Earth's atmosphere and crash-lands near the verdant Mossy Bottom Farm. Now, Lu-La, the extraordinary friendly creature from the depths of the galaxy, is in grave danger, light-years away from home. Can Shaun, and the rest of the lambs, lend a helping hand, and protect their new extraterrestrial companion from the Ministry of Alien Detection, and its unstoppable leader, Agent Red?â€”Nick Riganas

Between getting high with her roommate, Katie and snorting lines with her boss, Kelly she falls for Blue, a young man dealing drugs on her corner. Within days, the two are selling dime bags to her boss and his downtown friends and living the high life. Summer love crashes to a halt when Blue is arrested and she is left with a serious bag of his coke.

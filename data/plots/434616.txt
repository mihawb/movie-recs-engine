Bathing, dressing, walking, basketball - things Ben can no longer do when he lands at a physiotherapy center following a crippling accident. His new friends are tetraplegics, paraplegics, victims of head injury, the cream of the handicapped. Together they'll learn patience. They'll resist, show off, quarrel, and flirt, but above all, they'll find the strength to live again.â€”Happy_Evil_Dude

In the aftermath of a cataclysmic global disaster, with food being in short supply and grain used as currency, people now live in small communities, under adverse conditions. Not knowing what to expect, Louison, an unemployed ex-circus clown, arrives in a perpetually cold and misty part of post-apocalyptic France and rents an apartment in the dilapidated tenement building of the uncouth butcher, Mr Clapet, who rules his tenants with an iron fist. To pay his rent, Louison takes a job as a janitor, only to fall in love with a kindred spirit, the landlord's myopic daughter, Julie. However, amid chaos, destruction, and extreme hunger, Louison can't help noticing Clapet's impressive ability to find meat: a macabre secret that he will soon have to face. In the end, what makes Clapet's delicatessen so successful?â€”Nick Riganas

Based on the beloved children's novel by E.B. White, this is the story of a pig named Wilbur who was born a runt. John Arable decides to kill him for dinner food but his daughter, Fern, begs him to let him live. On greater maturity, he is sold to Fern's uncle, Homer Zuckerman, in whose barnyard he's left yearning for friendship, but is snubbed by the other animals. He is scared of the end of the season, because he knows that come that time, he will end up on the dinner table. He hatches a plan with Charlotte, a gentle and wise gray spider that lives above his pen, to ensure that this will never happen.â€”Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au>

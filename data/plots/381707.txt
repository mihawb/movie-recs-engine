Carlos goes to a coffee shop-library for a cup of coffee, where Irene is reading a book. Irene sits close to Carlos and talks with him, starting a friendship with a few rules: no pasts, no birth names, no modern ways to contact each other (such as Internet), and finally not falling in love with each other. Calling themselves Hada Chalada ('Crazy Fairy') and Duende Chiflado ('Mad Goblin'), both pass the days walking around the city engaged in magic, surrealist, funny conversations about life, love, and themselves, at the same time that Carlos tries to complete his latest script with his friend Cristóbal, an eccentric writer obsessed with Japan. But the good feeling between Carlos and Irene ends suddenly when Irene discovers that Carlos is really the husband of María, new lover of Jorge, Irene's boyfriend, who recently split with her in favor of Carlos' wife. When the four casually turn up at the same place, Carlos must confront his feelings about Irene and his marriage to Maria; meanwhile Irene confronts Jorge about his love affair.—Chockys

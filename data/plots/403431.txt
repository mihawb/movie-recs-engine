Superfan James (Mooney) is obsessed with the clever if quaintly goofy kids' show Brigsby Bear to the point of religiosity. A bright, sensitive young adult still living at home, he has grown up with this fantasy series, and the program has grown with him as well - getting more complex over the years. But when the show abruptly ends, James's life changes forever, and he sets out to finish the story himself.

Brazilian MD Drauzio Varella starts AIDS prevention in Brazil's largest prison, Carandiru in São Paulo, where the population is nearly double its 4,000 maximum.

Just when he believes to leave the prisoners happy with a soccer tournament, a silly clothing-line argument kick-starts a politically opportune revolt repression.—KGF Vissers

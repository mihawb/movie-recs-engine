At night, all around town, Mater the disheveled tow truck is causing havoc, playing tricks, disturbing the peace, and scaring other motor vehicles. At Flo's V-8 café, the local cop car warns Mater about the ghostlight, a legendary orb of blue that haunts these parts. The cop car tells the story and warns one and all that the ghostlight hates the sound of clanking metal.

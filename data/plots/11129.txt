The Cardiff club scene in the '90s: five best friends deal with their relationships and personal demons during a weekend. Jip calls himself a sexual paranoid, afraid he's impotent. Lulu, Jip's mate, doesn't find much to fancy in men. Nina hates her job at a fast-food joint, and her man Koop, who dreams of being a great hip-hop D.J., is prone to fits of unprovoked jealousy. The fifth is Moff, whose family is down on his behavior. Starting Friday afternoon, with preparations for clubbing, we follow the five from Ecstasy-induced fun through a booze-laden come-down early Saturday morning, followed by the weekend's aftermath. It's breakthrough time for at least three of them.â€”<jhailey@hotmail.com>

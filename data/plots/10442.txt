Charlie MacKenzie is a dedicated San Francisco coffeehouse poet whose poems concern his numerous failed relationships, which have all ended because of some weird, inexcusable paranoia. His mother May and best friend Tony can only criticize him for his wrongdoings. But he believes he very well may have found the perfect woman in Harriet, a meat butcher with a heart of gold. But Charlie begins suspecting something about Harriet that may not be so perfect.â€”MonkeyKingMA

Widower, single father and former cop Tom Carver (Samuel L. Jackson) now has an unusually gruesome vocation -- having to immaculately clean up even the grossest and abjectly gory of crime scenes, purposefully leaving the area so spotless that those next to occupy the premises would never have a clue of there being even the slightest thing amiss. But when he's called in to sterilize one particular wealthy suburban residence following a brutal shooting, Carver is deeply shocked to learn that his meticulous skills may not only have erased crucial undocumented evidence, but might have dangerously entangled himself in a dirty and far-reaching cover up, as well. Directed by Renny Harlin and co-starring Eva Mendes, Ed Harris, Keke Palmer, and Luis Guzman, Cleaner is a dark, gritty and suspenseful crime thriller that proves that the grim task of simply cleaning up gore can be the one of the dirtiest jobs there is.

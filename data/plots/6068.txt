In New York, the assistant magazine editor Robin Monroe has dinner with her boyfriend Frank Martin that invites her to spend six days and seven nights in the paradisiacal island Makatea. When they arrive in Tahiti, they take the charter owned by the rough middle-aged pilot Quinn Harris and assisted by his friend, the hot Angelica. On the arrival in Makatea, Frank proposes Robin and gives a ring to her. However, her editor Marjorie asks Robin to fly to Tahiti to cover a story and she hires Quinn, who has the only available plane, to travel during the night. Out of the blue, the weather changes and they crash on an uninhabited island. Now they have to support each other to survive and wait for the improbable rescue.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

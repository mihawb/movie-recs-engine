Estonia, 2007. Before worming her way into the unsuspecting, doomed family of Kate and John in Orphan (2009), 31-year-old Leena, the artful manipulator trapped in the body of a 9-year-old girl, was an inmate of the Saarne Institute. As murderous Leena masterminds her brutal escape from the mental hospital, she makes her way to the United States and sinks her teeth into the wealthy American family of Tricia and Allen Albright. But her hands are already stained in blood, and violence invites tragedy. Now, the devious woman gives her all to fit in with the Albrights; however, will the charming little psychopath get the love and support she thinks she deserves?â€”Nick Riganas

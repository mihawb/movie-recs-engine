Oberst Kurt Steiner (Sir Michael Caine) is a German Officer in World War II who has been court-martialled for opposing the S.S. in rounding up Jews. He is offered an assignment to go to England and abduct Sir Winston Churchill. His loyal parachute group dress as Polish soldiers and take over a small English town, supposedly on a training maneuver to await the coming visit of the Prime Minister.â€”John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net>

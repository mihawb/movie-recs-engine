The Evangelion saga from TV is artfully recounted, with some additional scenes, in part one see: "Shin Seiki Evangelion" (1995) Part two starts immediately afterward, where the NERV organization has outlived its usefulness. The shadowy covenant of SEELE launches an all-out commando assault against the ill-defended headquarters. Asuka, semi-comatose, is placed in her EVA for safety, while Misato and company struggle to find Shinji and Rei before they're assasinated by SEELE's forces.â€”SpaceToast

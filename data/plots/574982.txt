Suddenly, the whole world, except for the territory around Moscow, part of Belarus, Ukraine, Finland (which will later be called the "Circle of Life") is plunged into darkness, the fate of millions of people is unknown. The connection broke with most of the Earth and only a small number of people in the "Circle of Life" survive. People drew a new border, set up a protective perimeter, and sent reconnaissance groups beyond. They realized that there was an attack on Earth, as a result of which almost all living creatures died. To repulse the mysterious enemy, they mobilized an army, and outposts were built outside the perimeter.â€”Peter-Patrick76 (peter-patrick@mail.com)

The Kingdom of Dahomey, West Africa, 1823. Having sworn to risk life and limb to protect the land, formidable General Nanisca and the Agojie, the elite, all-female military regiment of King Ghezo, keep the bellicose Oyo Empire at bay. In the meantime, as the unbroken sisterhood trains a new generation of fearless warriors, their battle-scarred leader seeks alternative sources of profit. However, Ghezo's participation in the slave trade paves the way for the inevitable violent confrontation between the Agojie, the Oyo, and the slavers that will compromise the kingdom's future.â€”Nick Riganas

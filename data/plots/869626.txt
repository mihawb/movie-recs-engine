Marcel, a googly-eyed, 1-inch-tall mollusc, and his only relative, wise grandmother Connie, live a peaceful, solitary life in a vacant house now used as an Airbnb. However, when young filmmaker Dean stumbles upon the minuscule pair, his fascination with documenting opens up a world of endless possibilities and friendship. As a result, this unexpected event prompts tiny Marcel to reevaluate his life. And as Marcel becomes famous, he realises what matters in life. Will Marcel, the shell with shoes on, ever reunite with his missing family?â€”Nick Riganas

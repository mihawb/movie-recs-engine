The work is a reinterpretation of William Shakespeare's play The Taming of the Shrew.
Elia is a farmer who lives in isolation in Rovignano. Definitely antisocial, he does not like the city or company, but above all he is bothered by the presence of women, whom he sees as disturbers of rural peace. Mamy, the housekeeper, is the only female figure allowed on his farm: in an attempt to make him less irascible, he has tried several times to find a girl for Elia, but to no avail.
One evening, during a thunderstorm, the beautiful Lisa suffers a car breakdown and asks for hospitality at the farm of the misanthrope, where he has the opportunity to experience his rude ways. Over time, however, the girl discovers that she is in love with the rough peasant, even going so far as to betray her boyfriend Vittorio and to quarrel with her friend Renata, who also tries to seduce Elia.Lisa finally manages to seduce Elia: the two get married and Lisa chooses country life.
"Shakespeare revised and corrected by Castellano & Pipolo is like the Bible read and commented on by Pannella: a contradiction. The film barely holds up in the first part, then it loses the pieces along the way. In any case, sensational collections at the cinema."
"Out of modesty it is good to omit the name of Shakespeare from this modern version of 'The Taming of the Shrew' bent to the needs of the character that Celentano animates with some gimmicks. But the film is shot with the left hand."
This is the first movie with collaboration of Adriano Celentano and Ornella Muti.

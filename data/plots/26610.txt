In Troms, Swedish cops aid the Norwegian police in hunting for the murderer of a girl, 15. They track a suspect; in the fog near the sea he seems to escape, wounding one policeman. One of the Swedes, Jonas Engström, fires his revolver, accidentally killing his partner. He then tries to cover it up. Over the next several days, the sleepless Engström manipulates the evidence of his partner's death more and more elaborately as he and others pursue the girl's killer. Then, he hears from the killer, who has observed him shoot his partner. Is a net closing in on Engström? Will someone police the police?—<jhailey@hotmail.com>

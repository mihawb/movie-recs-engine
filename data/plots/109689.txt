Hache (Mario Casas) flies back to Barcelona after spending two years in London, trying to forget his first love and the death of his best friend Pollo (Álvaro Cervantes). His brother picks him up from the airport; after he settles himself in, he sees his bike covered with a sheet. H. takes his bike for a spin and lands in the port where he used to race illegally. As soon as he gets there he receives a call; Katina (Marina Salas) found out through Hache's brother Álex that he just got back; they agree to meet at a park. When he arrives at the park, Hache sees Chino (Lucho Fernandez), who tells him that things have changed. Chino invites him to a get-together in a restaurant with their other friends. He sits waiting on a bench, Katina arrives, and they catch up. Katina asks Hache if he has missed Babi (Maria Valverde) and tells him that she's seen her and she has changed. Hache invites her to the get-together, but Katina declines the invitation and they part ways promising to keep in touch. H. gets on his motorcycle and is seen being followed by Gin (Clara Lago).

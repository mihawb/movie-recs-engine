Two years after their first adventure, Tad Jones and Sara Lavrof have separate lives; he is a construction worker studying archaeology, and she is a renowned archaeologist and explorer. After discovering the final clue of the existence of King Midas' necklace, Sara invites Tad to an exposition in Las Vegas, where he hopes that she will agree to be his girlfriend. Just before they set off, Tad realizes that the mummy of Paititi has been exiled from the Inca city because of him, and the mummy appears at Tad's doorstep, forcing him to travel to Las Vegas with his dog Jeff and the mummy. But all Tad's hopes fade when millionaire Jack Rackham kidnaps Sara to force her to reveal the location of the three parts of Midas' necklace. Forming a team with Mummy, Sara's scholar Tiffany, Jeff, and Sara's grouchy, intelligent pet bird Belzoni, Tad Jones and his friends travel around the world trying to rescue Sara and defeat Rackham before he receives all the necklace's power to turn everything he touches into gold.â€”Chockys

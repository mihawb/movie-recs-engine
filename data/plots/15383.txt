In 1942, French engineer and Resistant cell leader Philippe Gerbier is arrested and sent to a concentration camp. He manages to escape, and together with Felix Lepercq and Resistance hit-man Claude "The Mask" Ullmann, they kidnap the traitor that gave him away to the Germans and execute him. Gerbier travels to London to discuss Allied logistical support for the Resistance; meanwhile, Felix is captured by the Germans and tortured. Resistance members Mathilde, Guillaume "Bison" Vermersch, and the Mask try unsuccessfully to rescue him. But Jean François Jardie, brother of Resistance commandant Luc Jardie, sacrifices himself to deliver a cyanide pill to Felix in prison. As the months go by the organization continues its clandestine operations until the day a captured member, tortured by the Germans, becomes a threat to the mission. He will have to be assassinated.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

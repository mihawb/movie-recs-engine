Roland and Vanessa, an unhappily married couple traveling through France, stay at a hotel by the sea. Roland, a failing writer, sits at the bar all day drinking while working on his book. Vanessa suffers from mental illness and spends most of her time in their room. When they are together, they argue frequently. A pair of newlyweds are staying in the room next to theirs. Roland and Vanessa start to spy on them through a hole in the wall, and Vanessa becomes obsessed with their lives.â€”Patrick Lin

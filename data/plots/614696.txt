Without warning, people in the streets of Seoul become extremely violent, cannibalistic, attacking passersby, behaving like zombies. A young man alone in his parents' 4th floor apartment becomes spectator to all this. There're no groceries left in the apartment. He foolishly opens the door and a neighbor forces himself in. He's infected but is finally forced out. TV informs him that the virus is spreading nationwide. As the days pass, the phone and internet stop working, then the water's gone. When all hope is gone, he sees a cute girl in the apartment across from his.â€”Scott Filtenborg

Leading a parasitic life, Bobby and Marty are two teenagers growing up in the suburbs of South Florida. Bobby treats Marty like garbage, taking great pleasure in humiliating, and even beating him. One day, they organise a double date on the beach with high school dropouts, beautiful Ali (who likes Bobby), and her best friend, Lisa, and as one thing leads to another, a love affair begins between Marty and Lisa. But, more and more, Marty wants out, desperate to escape from the clutches of his friend, and his destructive influence; however, Bobby is not willing to take this situation lying down. Then, after a brutal sexual assault, the team has an epiphany: what if they put abusive Bobby out of the way?â€”Nick Riganas

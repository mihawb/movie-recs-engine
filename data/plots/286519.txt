Orphaned at 11 by his single mother's death, wayward Texan rebel Stet is removed from his hometown by rich New York 'uncle' Gerard--actually his discrete father who never told his official family. At the recommendation of his music teacher, his vocal talent is acknowledged by director Carvelle of the Canadian National Boys Choir, a prestigious elite boarding school, and Gerard pays to keep him away. Adapting to the Streber discipline is hard, but the ruthless competition from start singer Devon, unconditionally supported by deputy head Drake, is precisely what helps motivate, and success makes mates. Still, the way to the top is hard, and shortly after he reaches his best for a prestigious New York concert, nature cruelly kicks in.â€”KGF Vissers

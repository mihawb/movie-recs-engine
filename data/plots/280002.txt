During the wedding of Skylar and Dan there is an apocalyptic event that kills most of the guests. The survivors are the newlywed couple and their friends Tommy, Jack and Allison. Skylar is mysteriously wounded and the teenager Sam joins the group that seeks shelter in the church of Pastor Shay that is convinced that they are living The Rapture from the Bible. They discuss faith and the fate of the survivors that are doomed to die.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

On the eve of her sixteenth birthday, the typical New York City teenager, Clary Fray, has a shocking revelation: instead of being an ordinary girl, Clary discovers that she is part of a mythical race: the Shadowhunters, protectors of humanity. Against the backdrop of the eternal battle between good and the dark forces of evil, Clary will find herself amid a fierce war with the supernatural, when her mother, Jocelyn, is abducted. In her desperate attempt to save her, the fellow demon-hunter, Jace, will be Clary's guide and guardian, as they both delve deeper and deeper into a nightmarish realm infested with mighty adversaries. Can they escape from the netherworld?â€”Nick Riganas

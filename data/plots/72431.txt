The 332nd Fighter Group, an all-black World War II unit made up of the best escort pilots and known as the Red Tails, fights racism at home while fighting the Germans abroad in this action-packed drama based on the true story of the Tuskegee Airmen. The movie also looks a little bit at the men as individuals. We get to know some of their strengths, weaknesses, and dreams. One doesn't follow directions, and is highly aggressive fighter. One is captured by the Germans. One drinks whiskey. A couple die due to combat wounds. One is badly wounded and sent home. The pilots finally get a more responsible assignment, do well, and then are given more responsible assignments. The end of the picture shows the unit getting recognition for a job well done.

After unwittingly resurrecting The Archduke of Nightmares, an ancient, murderous creature from the Planet Gigax, brother and sister, Luke and Mimi, have a crisis on their hands. On the one hand, the only thing that stands between the alien overlord and global annihilation is a strange pulsating gem of destruction, and on the other hand, the demon's arch-enemies called The Templars, have already dispatched Pandora, a mighty, sword-wielding defender, to stop him at all costs. Now, it seems that whoever wins, humans lose. Can the little suburban siblings control the beast, and in the process, save humankind?â€”Nick Riganas

The film is a strange, anti-hero transposition of a very popular animated manga cartoon in the 1980s called Steel Jeeg. Here, young outlaw Enzo is somehow affected by radioactive waste in the Tiber waters in Rome. He subsequently finds out he has gained super powers and interprets them as a reward for never having managed to enter the criminal world significantly. The inside joke reveals itself when Enzo meets Alessia, who believes the charming hero is the personification of the hero in the cartoon she used to watch.

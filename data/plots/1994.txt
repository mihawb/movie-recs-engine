Joel McCrea plays Bob, a renowned big game hunter and author whose ship sinks off a small island. Bob, as sole survivor, makes his way across the island to a castle seeking refuge. There he is greeted by master of the castle, Count Zaroff, played by Leslie Banks. Zaroff offers Bob his hospitality and soon he is introduced to Martin and Eve who explain they were also recently shipwrecked along with two sailors in their party. When an opportunity arises to speak privately with Bob, Eve conveys her suspicions that all is not right. It appears that after being given a tour of the Count's mysterious locked trophy room, the two sailors went out hunting but have not returned. As Count Zaroff regales the group with his hunting exploits, he reveals an insatiable need to hunt more and more challenging game. He claims he was bored until he discovered "the most dangerous game" on his island. It does not take long before Eve and Bob discover exactly what the most dangerous game is: humans, who the Count hunts on the island, hanging their heads in his trophy room. They find themselves prey in a contest to see if they can survive the night and thereby win their freedom and safe passage off of the island. What ensues is a fast-paced thriller in which Bob and Eve must keep themselves alive amongst the elements of the island-dense jungle, impenetrable fog, perilous cliffs, dangerous waterfalls, and treacherous bog while on the run from their hunter and his pack of vicious dogs. The hunt is an edge-of-your-seat nail-biter. In the end, Bob truly understands what it is to be the hunted rather than the hunter, and it changes his perspective forever.â€”KS at ClassicCouple.com

A totally blind vietnam vet comes back to help this boy and mother who are being chased by criminals. The blind man is a swords man, who fights against people with guns, swords, drives a car, and does it all better than anyone with 20/20 vision. No matter what the challenge, the blind man can take away guns, dodge bullets, and fight with a sword or stick equally well. A sighted person would have great trouble duplicating everything this blind guy does. Yes, he may have been a Shaolin Monk back in Vietnam, or trained with them, but blind is still blind. As the movie progresses the absurdity of the whole thing starts to wear a little thin on the viewer, and there just is no way to suspend belief and tell yourself that this could ever happen in real life. And since the film is an action film and not science fiction, there should be some attachment to reality. This is surely the dumbest movie ever made, bar none, and the only reason to watch it at all is if you are a Brandon Call fan.

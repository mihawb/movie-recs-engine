Two weeks later, after seeing that no one is claiming her back, the two decide to let her stay in at their home temporarily, and so give a twist to their love life in the process. But it won't be that easy, since the girl is obsessed with the fantasy that a monster will come out and punish her if she ever steps out of a chalk square painted on the floor.

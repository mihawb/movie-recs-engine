In 1911, in Paris, the bold journalist Adèle Blanc-Sec is assigned by her editor to travel to Peru to write about the Incas, but she goes to Egypt instead to seek out the mummy of a doctor of Ramses II to bring him to Paris. Adèle has an agreement with Professor Marie-Joseph Espérandieu that has the ability of bringing the dead back to life to resurrect the doctor to heel her twin sister Agathe Blanc-Sec, who has been catatonic and paraplegic for five years due to an accident caused by Adèle. However, Professor Espérandieu is arrested in prison and sentenced to death after bringing to life a pterodactyl from an ancient egg in Louvre that caused the death of three persons. Now the last hope of Agathe is that Adèle saves Professor Espérandieu from the guillotine.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

Surprised by their accidental pregnancies, Janis, an accomplished 40-year-old professional photographer, and Ana, an utterly unprepared, wide-eyed teenager, find themselves in a Madrid maternity ward. Now, two single women are about to give birth to their first child--one is nervous, the other is looking forward to embracing the experience. Under those circumstances, as infallible maternal instincts start to kick in, the deep traumas of the past give way to female solidarity, paving the way for an unforeseen but profound bond between the two parallel mothers. Indeed, life can be full of unexpected things, either happy or sad, and little by little, the miracle of motherhood intertwines with the mystery of death, and somehow, Spain's troubled history. And, suddenly, the deeply buried truth needs to be told.â€”Nick Riganas

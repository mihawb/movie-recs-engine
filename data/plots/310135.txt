In Wasteland's vast and barren deserts of scrap and debris in a post-apocalyptic 1997 where water is the new currency, the reclusive orphaned scavenger and die-hard comic aficionado known only as the Kid, barely manages to survive, trading relics of a bygone time for food and water. Living constantly under the sadistic monarch Zeus' heavy thumb, the Kid who struggles to lay low, is utterly unprepared for the unforeseen encounter--let alone, friendship--with the lively and free-spirited, Apple, who can't take no for an answer. However, only when Apple falls into Zeus' hands will Kid realise that his beloved Turbo Rider's newly-found high-tech justice-enforcing gear is meant for a true hero sworn to defend those in need. Will the skittish Kid step up to truly become the Turbo Kid?â€”Nick Riganas

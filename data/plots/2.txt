Taisto Kasurinen is a miner in a remote Finnish town. After the mine where he works shuts down permanently, he is given an unusual send-off by his father as he heads toward Helsinki to start a new life. That send off includes his father giving him his broken down, older model convertible whose top is now permanently in the down position. Taisto has little money in his pockets and needs to work odd jobs along the way to survive. On his way to Helsinki and once in Helsinki, Taisto gets into one misadventure after another. But the one bright spot for him in Helsinki is meeting single mother Irmeli Pihlaja, who works several jobs in order to pay for the modest items in her possession she has paid for in installments. They quickly fall for each other and plan to get married, that plan which hits a snag when an incident befalls Taisto. Although marrying Irmeli is foremost on his mind, he will have to decide how far he will go to achieve that end goal, and what that end goal will look like for him, Irmeli and her adolescent son.â€”Huggo

The senior partner of a US law firm, eager to finish an estate sale in rustic Canada before Christmas, entrusts it to workaholic junior Kate, suggesting it may swing her promotion to partner. When she arrives, the required expert hired to inspect it leaves inconclusively, the latest scare-victim of the locally repute house ghost. The caretaker fails to scare her off though, she even insists to stay there alone, and isn't daunted when she meet ghost Daniel. He's a gentleman who was trapped by a curse since his murder there during the Prohibition, nicknamed Christmas spirit because he only materializes on the twelve days of Christmas, and refuses to 'waste' that time on more fruitless efforts to study and break his curse, yet gets dragged in by Kate, while both get mutual crushes, tested by conflicting loyalties to her job and his former fiancee, also a ghost.â€”KGF Vissers

When François, a journalist, is touring a big store for an article, he is chosen by the son of the owner, Rambal-Cochet, as his new toy. All afraid of the despotic industrialist who is also the newspaper's owner, François is forced to agree to this masquerade. Becoming the friend of the child, he induces him, who wants to make a newspaper, to unveil publicly the real tyrannical way of life of his father.—Jean-Marie Berthiaume <jiembe@videotron.ca>

Maks and Albert agree to take part in a scientific experiment involving hibernation. The experiment is only supposed to last a couple of years; but after getting defrosted, they find themselves in a society they can't begin to understand. They gradually discover that the world has gone to hell and there are only women left on the planet, living in a humongous underground "Vault" (like in the game Fallout, only a lot larger ;) and ruled by the radical Women's League, which was barely even established in their day. The League has developed a thorough system of propaganda, human control and changed history, which focuses mainly on how "males" used to be absolutely evil (at one point when Maks and Albert are trying to defend men, they are told that "Einstein was a woman" and that "one man named Cain invented murder and tested it on his sister Abel"). However, they manage to instill doubt in one woman and with her help discover that not everything - if anything - is as it seems...â€”DJS

It's Halloween night in Brooklyn. Chris, a lonesome and unremarkable fellow, finds a mysterious invitation on the street and follows it to what he thinks will be a fun costume party. It turns out to be a lethal trap set by a gang of deranged hipster artists. Their plan is to lure someone to their remote warehouse base and ritually murder them as part of an extreme artistic event. It's all to impress their wealthy and sinister guru/patron, who soon arrives with promises of grant money and his dead-eyed henchman. As the booze-and-drug-fueled night wears on, rivalries within the group flare up with violent consequences. A body count accrues and Chris must take advantage of the ensuing chaos if he's ever to escape the warehouse and survive the night. [D-Man2010]

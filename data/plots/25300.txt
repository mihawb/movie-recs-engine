Michele Amitrano is a true country bambino (10): cute as an angel, curious and enterprising as a rascal and means everything to his parents. Father Pino Amitrano is a truck driver, and is often away. Even when he's at home he deals with dodgy villagers and other friends, while mother Anna spoils his useless kid sister Maria rotten. Michele is mostly left doing his sisters chores, getting either of them out of trouble, roaming the sparsely populated grain lands on his bicycle and playing with local kids, which often means minor trouble. One day after a dare leads the mildly mischievous gang to a ruined house, he returns alone to retrieve the glasses that his sister had left behind. Michele accidentally finds a deep hole outside, beneath a metal cover, and sees a boy's bare foot under a blanket inside. At first Michele rides off for his life, but soon he returns, and after some more scary and disappointing tries finds out it's a boy his age, blinded by a living his life in the dark, deep hole. Michele conquers his fear and the boy, Filippo's, confidence, and generously feeds and entertains him. Overhearing his parents and their friends returning to this hole, Michele soon suspects that Filippo is a wealthy family's kidnapped son.â€”KGF Vissers

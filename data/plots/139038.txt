In August 2012, young couple Malcolm and Kisha move in together. As Kisha arrives, she accidentally runs Malcolm's dog Shiloh over with her car. On the first night, Kisha's loud farting keeps awakening Malcolm and eventually drives him out of the room. When Kisha notices her keys on the floor the next morning, she tells Malcolm they might have a ghost. To prove her wrong, Malcolm invites over cameramen Dan the Security Man and his brother Bobby. Malcolm tries to have sex with the camera on, but Kisha tells him to turn it off. Before they really start, Malcolm turns the camera back on and records everything. In the morning, Malcolm and Kisha watch the video and notice that the door moved, and Malcolm suggests it was caused by his lovemaking. The next night, Malcolm notices the paranormal activity and tries to move out of the house and leave Kisha. Since he can't sell his house in the current market, they hire Chip, a psychic, to investigate, and Chip immediately falls in love with Malcolm. Chip finds nothing wrong and is about to leave when Kisha confesses to making a deal with the devil for a pair of shoes. Chip tells Kisha she is screwed and invites Malcolm to a wrestling match. After Chip leaves, Kisha shows Malcolm a video of her eighth birthday, in which she began to experience paranormal activity by her imaginary friend Tony. The next night, Kisha awakens in the middle of the night, stands by the bed for several hours, and begins to dance. Malcolm wakes up and follows Kisha to the kitchen, where he catches her eating uncooked food and drinking old milk. She screams crazily when Malcolm restrains her. In the morning, Kisha remembers nothing.

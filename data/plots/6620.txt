The daughter of a chauffeur (Sabrina, played by Hepburn) has been madly in love with the youngest playboy son (David, played by Holden) of a Long Island society family. Although he was never serious about the young woman, she dreams he will one day fall madly in love with her. She moves to Paris to become a chef, and returns to Long Island a changed woman on the outside. Inside, Sabrina is still madly in love with David. When David invites her to a ball at the mansion, she is delirious with delight. This affair, however, jeopardizes not only David's impending marriage, but a business deal brokered by his older, responsible brother, Linus (played by Bogart). Linus arranges an unfortunate "accident" that lays David up for several days. Linus then proceeds to woo Sabrina - even convincing David he's doing this for him. Linus pretends that Sabrina has made him curious about what it would be like to leave his corporate world behind and live in Paris. Sabrina believes she's seeing a "secret side" of Linus Larabee, and starts falling in love with this new Linus. Linus entices Sabrina to run away with him and move back to Paris - even though he has no intentions of leaving with her. At the last minute, Linus realizes he cannot hurt her like this and arranges to send David (who has recovered from the accident) in his place. David realizes Sabrina no longer loves him, and (surprisingly) his older brother is in-love with Sabrina. So David arranges to have true love find its course, and the two lovers sail to Paris.

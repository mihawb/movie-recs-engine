While serving time for a violent crime 20-year-old Daniel has found his life's calling serving Christ. His unconventional charisma and genuine passion for the Word curry favor with the prison's Catholic chaplain and qualify him to assist worship services. When a menacing addition to the facility threatens Daniel's progress, the chaplain secures his timely release. Barred from attending seminary by his criminal record, Daniel is sent to work a dead-end job laboring in a small-town mill for the reformed. Upon arrival, he encounters a spiritually fractured community suffering from a series of interpersonal crises - dark secrets and hypocrisies actively undermine parish unity. The heavens clearly have plans for Daniel outside of the mill and, in good faith, he steps up to the altar to improvise answers for a community adrift without leadership.â€”Mae Moreno

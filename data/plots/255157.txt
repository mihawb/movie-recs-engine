In Boston, the forger Raymond J. Cutter has only ten more months from his sentence to be released from prison. However, he asks his lawyer to contact the criminal lord Keegan to be immediately released, despite the advises of his lawyer and his best friend Carl. Keegan's bribed judge releases him and Ray goes home, where he meets his father Joseph Cutter, who raises his fifteen years-old estranged son Will Cutter. Ray visits Keegan in his nightclub and learns that he must forge a painting by Monet to pay his debts. While leaving the nightclub, Ray stumbles upon the uncovered Agent Paisley and becomes his person of interest. Ray needs to forge the painting, while he grants three wishes to his terminal son, who is stage four brain cancer. Ray tries to grant the wishes of his son, while is pressed by Keegan and Paisley and her partner Detective Devlin that are investigating him because of his connection with Keegan.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

HAndy MrMicx met his future wife Vicky while they were earning money by participating in an experiment in which they were given a dose of a chemical called LOT-7, while they were in college. Andy and Vicky went on to get married and they now have a nine-year-old daughter named Charlene "Charlie" McGee, who has the ability to start fires at will (pyrokinesis) as a result of the experiment that Andy and Vicky participated in. The experiment also gave Andy the ability to make people do what he wants. A secret government department known as "The Shop" did the experiment, and now The Shop, run by Doctor Joseph Wanless, has been pursuing Andy and Charlie, even killing Vicky in order to get her out of the way. Wanless and his organization want to study Andy and Charlie, then kill them, and The Shop has sent a sniper named John Rainbird to find Andy and Charlie. What Wanless and his group underestimate is what Andy and Charlie are willing to do to protect each other.â€”Todd Baldridge

Not everyone loves summertime. For Sara, it just means dealing with a constant barrage of mockery, judgment, and abuse from the other girls in her village. But today is different. A mysterious unknown man arrives in the village and kidnaps her tormentors. Someone has finally stood up for her. Sara sees it all: the blood, the mud, the knife, and the van in which he has taken them. And the unknown man has seen her. A wordless pact that neither will betray. She's an accomplice now. A series of crimes rock the village, and an investigation soon begins. The civil guard has endless questions, the villagers are suspicious and point fingers, the elderly neighbors gossip. The heat is stifling, the pressure suffocating, her guilt tormenting. What if she is found out? What's happened to the girls? What if the unknown man returns?â€”Morena Films

In contemporary L.A., two twenty-somethings millennials, Martin, a pharmacist, and Gabi, a physical therapy assistant, spend their weekends "swiping" on a dating app. The options are endless, but it's less about connection and more about hooking-up. But when they meet, they find themselves talking into the early hours. Connecting. It's exciting. It's new. They fall in love. Exhilarated by each other, they rush into a relationship. They go out on dates. They move in together. They skip work to make love - But soon the relationship becomes boring. And they decide to try an open relationship.

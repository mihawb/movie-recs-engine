A series of surreal moving images loosely tied together by common actors are presented. Underneath a moonlit sky, a woman's eye is cut open by a razor blade. While a young woman in her apartment deals with a cyclist who took a tumble outside her building, the police, another young woman, and a crowd of onlookers deal with the aftermath of the accident itself on the street. Two young men have an altercation resulting in one of the men dying and being transported away to another world. The young man and woman in the apartment begin to transform themselves both manually and magically with other objects of their persons. The young woman then leaves the apartment and is transported to another location where she and another man marvel at what has happened with the man she just left. The two have a somewhat ambiguous end to their story.â€”Huggo

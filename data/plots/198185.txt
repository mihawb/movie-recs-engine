The company is in serious financial straits, and they lose the big client they've been grooming. In a fit of inspiration, J.B. believes they can go to India, find a cricket bowler, and teach him to be a baseball pitcher. In order to pay for the scheme, he convinces wealthy businessman Chang (Tzi Ma) to create a reality show titled "Million Dollar Arm" to help with his quest for fresh talent. Upon arriving in India, he is quickly befriended by Amit (Pitobash), an overly-eager man who loves baseball and will do anything he can to help. J.B. also brings in retired scout Ray (Alan Arkin) to help him weed through the thousands of candidates who try to whip a baseball over 90 mph. Although at first the going is rough, they eventually find a pair of eager and promising prospects: Dinesh (Madhur Mittal) and Rinku (Suraj Sharma). The duo travel back to the States with J.B. where they are then tutored by Tom House (Bill Paxton), a USC baseball coach whose approach to the game is as much mental as physical. The two young men are finally given a highly publicized tryout in front of scouts from numerous pro teams, as well as media from around the world. Meanwhile, the fiercely single J.B., whose personal life involves dating a string of models, begins to strike up a serious romance with his tenant Brenda (Lake Bell), a doctor who rents the guest house on his beautiful L.A. estate..

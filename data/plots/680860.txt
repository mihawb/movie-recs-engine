Noah breaks up with Emma after 18 months together, and Anne breaks up with Peter after 6 years. Both Noah and Anne have found new significant others. Emma, a receptionist on the 14th floor, and Peter, a VP on the 11th floor, find each other sobbing in the stairwell. They support each other and end up forming an alliance to destroy each other's exes' new relationships. They cyber-stalk their exes, and Peter gets close to Noah while Emma gets close to Anne's new boyfriend.â€”Scott Filtenborg

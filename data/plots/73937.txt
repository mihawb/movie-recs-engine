Brad Harris (Jack Black) wants to become the greatest birder by winning the Big Year, a birding contest (not a photography contest). Kenny Bostick (Owen Wilson) is the current Big Year record holder, and other challengers abound, including Stu Preissler (Steve Martin), a retiring executive. Stu's family supports him, but Brad's father (Brian Dennehy) is not keen.The contestants travel all over North America (not the world), trying to see (or hear) the most birds. Bostick connives to throw others off, and Stu and Brad form an alliance. Stu's ex-coworkers try to get him back for a big deal, and Bostick's wife (Rosamund Pike) redecorates their house. They all hear of a storm, which will blow birds inland, and head to Houston. No one wants to admit they're chasing a Big Year, but they eventually find out about each other.Brad and Stu continue with their personal lives, but Kenny devotes all his time to birding. Brad's father begins to understand his passion. Stu and Brad begin to use Stu's resources to find birds, and Brad's father finds time to help his son.Even though Kenny wins the Big Year, Stu and Brad realize they've won more - friendship.

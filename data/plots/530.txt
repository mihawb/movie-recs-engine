Professor Wallace is a middle-aged, old, good-natured, crazy and clumsy though super-ingenious and extremely Wensleydale and cheese-obsessed inventor from Northern England and lives in the town of Wigan in the 1950's with his brave, loyal and intelligent pet, assistant helper, trusty sidekick, best friend and fellow inventor beagle dog, Gromit The Beagle Dog. they live in the red-brick household#62 on Western Wallaby Street. One evening they are searching for holidays in travel guides for a bank holiday weekend out, they are indecisive, Wallace goes to make some tea along with crackers with cheese, but suddenly realises that there's no cheese to go on them at all and that the house is clean out of them. It occurs to Wallace they can holiday somewhere abundant with cheese, the moon is shining brightly outside and "everybody knows it's made of cheese", the solution for both problems is decided. so Wallace goes truly ballistic and the two construct an orange homemade space rocket ship in their home basement (a very massive basement which they use for a laboratory and workspace), which blasts off and flies perfectly to the moon in outer space in search of their favourite snack to have a picnic holiday on the moon and eat the moon, once there they test a sample, but can't decide on it.They discover a coin-operated oven-like security alien space robot droid "The Moon Cooker Machine" and Wallace puts a coin in but nothing happens, so they keep walking, the robot activates and cleans up their picnic supplies, among them is a holiday guide which the robot reads, it fantasises about a skiing holiday and wishes to return to Earth. It discovers the rocket and writes up a parking ticket and notes an oil leak. The robot tracks Wallace and Gromit to another picnic spot and nearly hits Wallace over the head with a blackjack, but the money runs out and it freezes in place. Wallace takes the blackjack as a souvenir and places another coin in.They head back to the rocket and the robot jolts to life again, realising they can get to Earth with the rocket it chases them and attempts to catch them as punishment for stealing cheese moon-rock and trying to eat the moon, Wallace and Gromit seal the rocket behind them but they forget to light the fuse, the robot cuts at the fuselage with a can opener and breaks in and lights a match, which ignites the ignition and causes a huge blast, blowing the robot out with some debris and blowing the rocket into orbit.The robot is able to shape the debris into skiing equipment and skis across the moon surface on a skiing holiday, as the rocket heads home to Planet Earth again happily with the cheese.

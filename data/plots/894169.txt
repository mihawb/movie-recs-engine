In a suburban neighborhood in Georgia, William a family man and ex-marine is out to pick up dinner with his daughter Kat, a softball player hoping of playing professionally. While William fetches the food, Kat is waiting in the car. Unexpectedly the brothers Rory and Danny (the two sons of kingpin Donnie) show up and kill her. They are soon arrested by the police. However William (father of Kat) tricks the court by stating he does not recognize the killer. This allows killer Danny to go free and also allows William to revenge the killing of his daughter by taking matters in his own hand.â€”Frank Liesenborgs <frank.liesenborgs@gmail.com>

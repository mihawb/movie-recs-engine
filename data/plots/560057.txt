In a distant past, when towering marine animals infested the vast blue ocean and terrorised defenceless ships, generations of intrepid sailors confronted the fearsome creatures of the deep to protect the innocent. But when plucky orphan Maisie Brumble finds her way into legendary Captain Crow's unsinkable ship, the already complicated life of fearless monster hunter Jacob Holland is turned upside down. And as the wide-eyed stowaway and the seasoned mariner cross paths, they brace themselves for the ultimate challenge: end a 30-year vendetta by taking on the mythical Red Bluster, the greatest of all sea beasts.â€”Nick Riganas

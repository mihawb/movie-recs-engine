Josh Shrebnick and Cornelia Breitbart are married mid-forty-something New Yorkers. Josh, a documentary filmmaker and part-time college professor to help pay the bills, has been working on the same now over-bloated documentary project for ten years with no end in sight. As Josh likes to work without critical input, Cornelia, a producer, instead produces her father's movies, he famed documentarian, Leslie Breitbart. Josh and Leslie have an outwardly strained relationship in their many differences within the business. Beyond these issues, Josh and Cornelia hit a crossroads when their similarly aged best friends, Fletcher and Marina, have their first child, Fletcher and Marina who seem to be making new friends in other parents. Josh and Cornelia had once thought about having children, but had difficulty in trying to conceive leaving the thought now only a memory at this stage in their life. Things for Josh and Cornelia begin to take a turn when they befriend married mid-twenty-somethings Jamie and Darby Massey, also a documentary filmmaker and artisan ice cream maker respectively, they who decided to audit Josh's class in their admiration of his work. Jamie and Darby are self-assured hipsters who seem to make whatever they do work for their lives, at least to anyone looking in, such as Josh and Cornelia. Cornelia but especially Josh begin to mimic much of what they admire about Darby and Jamie, and thus take a step back a few decades in their lives. If they dig below the surface, Josh and Cornelia may find that Jamie and Darby are not all they initially appeared to be, but discovery of such may be too late to repair the damage that their association with the younger couple has taken on their own lives.â€”Huggo

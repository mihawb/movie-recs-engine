In a near future, the ordinary man above any suspicious from the suburb Morgan Sullivan is hired by Digicorp, a huge corporation, to be assigned as a spy and steal secrets from their competitors, Sunways. Along his training, Morgan is brainwashed, assumes a new identity of Jack Thursby and travels to boring lectures. In one of them, he is approached by the beautiful and mysterious Rita Foster, who advises him that nothing is how it seems to be. Morgan acknowledges a new reality, where he does not know who can be trusted.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

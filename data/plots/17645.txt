In this Technicolor noir, young novelist Richard Harland accepts an invitation to write on a friend's remote ranch. On the train ride to his New Mexican retreat, he meets beautiful Ellen Berent, a devoted daddy's girl on a mission to scatter her late father's ashes. Ellen sees so much of her beloved father in Richard while Richard is immediately drawn to her outward appearance. The two quickly fall in love and marry without really knowing much about the other. As Richard settles into married life with Ellen, her provocative nature emerges from the shadows and he is gradually separated from the people he loves most. The couple's once promising future together begins to resemble something other than the conventional love story he thought he committed to.â€”Mae Moreno

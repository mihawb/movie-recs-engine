In desperate need of a noble cause to revive their public images and bounce back, self-centered Broadway thespians Dee Dee Allen and Barry Glickman, the narcissistic stars of "Eleanor: The Eleanor Roosevelt Story," have come up with a foolproof plan to earn some positive publicity: the flamboyant celebrity activists and their fellow struggling actors, Angie Dickinson and Trent Oliver, head to the small town of Edgewater, Indiana, to help Emma, a bright-eyed high-school student who has recently come out, make her dream of taking her girlfriend to the prom come true in the face of intolerance. Can the bold quartet give Emma the prom she deserves?â€”Nick Riganas

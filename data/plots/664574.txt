Married couple Nell and Simon host a yearly Christmas dinner at their country estate for their former school friends and their spouses. This Christmas is a special occasion with everyone dressing in formal wear and the children being allowed to swear. It is gradually revealed that because of an imminent environmental catastrophe in which a rolling gas cloud is killing most life forms the British government has issued suicide pills for a quick and easy death before the cloud hits Britain. Nell, Simon and the rest of their friends have made a suicide pact to take the pills and give them to their children. However while James agrees with his friends over the decision his young wife Sophie has recently discovered she is pregnant and is still unsure whether to take the pill. Nell, Simon and their children video chat with Nell's mother, who is abroad, to say goodbye. The conversation leaves their eldest, Art, distressed. He begins to speculate that the government and the scientists are wrong. Art approaches James and Sophie with his fears. Sophie reveals that though she knows the poison will kill her she does not want to take the pill. Art then tells his mother that he wants to stay with Sophie and hold her hand until they both die. Nell and Simon are distressed and try to explain to Art that he must take the pill with the rest of the family. He refuses and runs away but discovers a family on the side of the road that are dead revealing the poison is already close. Returning home the group realizes it is past midnight and time to take their pills. They divide into their separate rooms to say goodbye. Before the family can take their pills Art, who has swallowed some of the poison, dies. James pressures Sophie to take the pill saying he will not unless she does too. The following morning everyone has died, except Arthur who opens his eyes.

T.J. Detweiler and his five best friends, Vince LaSalle, Ashley Spinelli, Gretchen Grundler, Mikey Blumberg and Gus Griswald, have finally at long last finished fourth grade at Third Street Elementary. But boredom quickly sets in as they leave for summer camp when T.J. uncovers an evil plot to do away with summer vacation. A crazy former principal, Dr. Phillium Benedict, is planning to use a laser beam that he stole from the US Military Base to alter the weather and create permanent winter. Naturally, T.J. rallies his best friends together and they conspire to fight the wicked Dr. Benedict. But it turns out that he is so strict that he wants to change the Moon's orbit in order to put the nation in a constant freeze, thus putting an end to summer and creating a year-round school year. It's now up to T.J. and the gang to save summer for kids all over the world.â€”Anthony Pereyra <hypersonic91@yahoo.com>

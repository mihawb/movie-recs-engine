Now back in Milan, Alberto is managing an efficiency-improvement program at the Italian Post. He devotes all his time and energy to this noble task but neglects his wife Silvia, which manage a program for efficiency improvement in the Italian Post. In devoting all his time and energy to this noble task, he neglects his wife Silvia, who is annoyed and hurt. Things go no better in Castellabate, where Mattia's wife Maria gets on his nerves by always bemoaning his lack of ambition. One day, a misunderstanding gets Mattia transferred to Milan, where he lands on Alberto's doorstep.â€”Guy Bellinger

Who meets by Fate, shall be sealed by Fate. Theresa Osborne is running along the beach when she stumbles upon a bottle washed up on the shore. Inside is a message, reading the letter she feels so moved and yet she felt as if she has violated someone's thoughts. In love with a man she has never met, Theresa tracks down the author of the letter to a small town in Wilmington, two lovers with crossed paths. But yet one can't let go of their past.â€”Ann Nonymous.

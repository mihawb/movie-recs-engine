Sometimes, it only takes a minute to change your life completely. In a small coastal village on the Black Sea, school's out for summer. Free-spirited Lale and her older sisters--Sonay, Selma, Ece, and Nur--whose ages range from 11 to 16, decide to head to the sea, and while fully clothed, innocently frolic on the beach with their male classmates. However, as the orphaned sisters return home, unbeknownst to them that scandalised neighbours have already managed a severe blow to their integrity, suspicion leads to captivity, and suddenly, the house becomes a prison and a wife factory. Now, to avoid the scandal, Uncle Erol has arranged to marry the girls off as quickly as possible. But, when conservatism gets in the way of emancipation, defiance is a way out. Can tradition break the bonds of sisterhood?â€”Nick Riganas

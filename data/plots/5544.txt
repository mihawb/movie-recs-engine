On assignment in Hiroshima to make her screen debut in an anti-war film, a young French actress has a fleeting but passionate affair with a Japanese architect who lives in town. However, as the ephemeral lovers exchange thoughts and memories during the remaining hours of her time in Hiroshima, painful flashbacks of her youthful wartime liaison in her native Nevers inextricably intertwine with the haunting remembrance of that appalling period in history. But soon, morning comes, and all that remains will be the nostalgia of an impossible love.â€”Nick Riganas

Fourteen long years after the culture shock he experienced in Borat (2006), Kazakh reporter Borat Sagdiyev has been called to Premier Nursultan Nazarbayev's office for a life-or-death task. To redeem himself and salvage the reputation of the glorious nation of Kazakhstan, Borat must now return to President Donald Trump's America to deliver an exceptional gift to Vice President Mike Pence. Instead, Borat's newfound 15-year-old daughter Tutar enters the picture, forcing a change of plans. As now-famous Borat takes a deep dive into U.S. politics, the father and daughter learn a thing or two about feminism, racism, and an insidious, lethal virus called COVID-19. Will Borat, Kazakhstan's fourth-best journalist, carry out his mission?â€”Nick Riganas

Baron Fefé Cefalù is a Sicilian nobleman bored of life and of his wife Rosalia: he falls in love with his beautiful young cousin Angela, who spends summers in the same palace. Since divorce is impossible in 1960s Italy, he decides to kill his wife, knowing that sentence would be very light if he proved that he committed murder for a matter of honour, such as finding her with another man. Therefore, he sets her up with painter Carmelo Patané, a painter well-known to her.—Alessio F. Bragadini <alessio@dsnet.it>

The Crypt keeper, while directing his new theatrical destruction, introduces this horror flick. It starts with Brayker (William Sadler), driving down a highway near a small town. He is being chased by a demon knight named The Collector, (Billy Zane) who is after an ancient relic that Brayker has. It contains the blood of Jesus, and deceased demon knights. That blood is the only thing that can stop a demon that powerful. Shortly after Brayker's car breakdown, Zane slams into it going over 100 m.p.h. Brayker escapes and makes it to a small hotel to hide out. The police show up and get a false story from The Collector who lies to them about Brayker and says that he stole the relic. Soon, the police bring The Collector to the motel to confront Brayker. After being arrested, Brayker gets free and the sheriff finds out that The Collector is no saint. Then, the fierce war begins. Brayker uses the relic to drive the collector from the motel, and The Collector summons an army of demons to help him kill Brayker and destroy the blood that can defeat him. Brayker has to get the 8 humans trapped inside through the night and orient his replacement. One by one the humans are possessed or conned and then killed by The Collector. The demons and the humans battle back and forth until The Collector's army is completely wiped out and Brayker and his new recruit, Jeryline (Jada Pinkett Smith) prepare for a final battle with the Collector for the survival of the human race. After the battle Brayker is dead and Jeryline kills The Collector. The movie ends when the new key guardian and a new Collector cross paths.

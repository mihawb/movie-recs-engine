The adventures of young Rémi, an orphan raised by the gentle Madam Barberin. At the age of 10 years, he is snatched from his adoptive mother and entrusted to Vitalis, a mysterious itinerant musician. At his side, Rémi will learn the harsh life of an acrobat and sing to win his bread. Accompanied by the faithful dog Capi and the small monkey Joli-Coeur, his long trip through France makes for meetings, friendships and mutual assistance, and leads him to the secret of his origins.—Hugo Van Herpe

Her friends are killed by the mutant cannibal 'Three Fingers', from the previous films. She is left to fend for herself, but not for long. Two days later a most dangerous mexican prisoner,Carlo Chavez,and group of prisoners are being transferred by Nate Wilson, a prison guard, on his last day before leaving to become a lawyer. On the way, Nate meets up with an old friend, Sheriff Calvin Carver, making viewers aware that Nate has been in these lands before. During transportation their bus is attacked by Three Fingers and they escape. While being chased through the woods, the prisoners led by Chavez, use Nate as a guide to lead them to a watch tower (which was the tower from the first movie) to issue an SOS. Officer Walter, now a prisoner, encounters Alex and an abandoned armored truck filled with cash. The money quickly becomes the prisoners' sole motivation for escape and survival. Chavez commands Walter to pick up one of the bags of money, but Walter refuses because of his injury from Three Fingers. Walter pulls out a gun and tries to shoot Chavez. Unfortunately, the gun was not loaded and Chavez kills Nate's friend.During the trail, they stumble upon a booby trap. The prisoners escape the booby trap set by Three-Toes (Three Finger's son from the previous film). They then catch the son and behead him, leaving a trophy on the spent booby trap for Three Fingers to find as a message. They soon realize it only made Three Fingers even more fearsome. One-by-one, Three Fingers hunts and murders every prisoner and kills the sheriff and his deputy. During the killings, Nate and Alex manage to escape. They are able to find the watch tower, which was badly burned years ago (first movie). Chavez decides to get rid of Nate, but instead promises him another way to get out. They find Three Finger's truck and Chavez uses Alex as bait. Three Fingers kidnapped Alex and Nate rescues her. Floyd steals the money and Chavez chases him down only to see his money burning and Floyd gets killed by Three Fingers. Three Fingers goes to another location to find the rest, until he is face to face with Chaveez and battles him with a Hatchet and a meat hook. Both beat one another, but Three Fingers eventually kills Chavez, hangs his corpse in a tree, removes his scalp and eats part of his brain. Nate finds Three Fingers' house with the help of the sheriff's dog and frees Alex. Three Fingers hides behind a door and ambushes Nate. The dog attacks Three Fingers to save them, but is killed by the hook. Alex stabs Three Fingers using the large stake that held Three Toes' head and believes she killed him. Nate and Alex take his tow truck and drive away. Thinking it's over, Three Fingers follows them and gets on top of the truck. Nate crashes into a tree and Brandon the prisoner, sees the whole thing and decides to help them. The truck catches fire and is about to explode, when Brandon gets Alex out then Nate. Three Fingers attempts to attack them but something goes wrong and he is finally killed when Nate stabs him in the head with his own meat hook.Sometime later, Nate returns to collect the remainig cash from the truck (the rest having been burned by "Three Fingers" earlier). But Brandon, who is one of the convicts that Nate let go, kills him with an arrow through the chest, with the retort, "Never trust a con". A cannibal (could've been Three Fingers for he had surived in each movie or someone new) appears holding a crude weapon dripping with blood (possibly the blood of Alex) and walks towards Brandon, as Brandon's scream and a hillbilly laugh is heard over the ending credits.

A vengeful nurse (Catherine Hiegel) gets back at the doctor (Daniel Gélin) she's been having an affair with by switching two babies in the maternity ward. The families taking home new babies couldn't be more different. The affluent Le Quesnoy family takes home a daughter, and the criminal-minded Groseilles take home a little boy. Neither family causes much of a fuss when they discover what's happened, so the switched girl (Valérie Lalande) and boy (Benoît Magimel) remain with the wrong families.

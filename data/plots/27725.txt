See Bogie at his best as world weary "Mad Dog Roy Earle" Given a pardon from jail he gets back into the swing of things as he robs a swanky resort. Which results in a botched caper. Bogie takes it on the lam with the always underated Ida Lupino and meets his destiny from a snipers bullet in the mountain tops. Arthur Kennedy in a good early role. Bogart had suffered many years at the hands of Warner brothers short sightedness. In this movie he got a chance to sink his teeth into it. Filled with classic noir elements as the doomed criminal who would rather be a farmer but must pull one last job. It's all there, the loping gait, thumbs shoved into his belt loops. Here is a man who must remain true to his inner convictions no matter how many coppers try to chase him down.

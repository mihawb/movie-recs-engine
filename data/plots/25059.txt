Shadow, Sassy, and Chance are back. It's been three years since their trek through the woods and over the mountains. Now their owners live in San Francisco and are taking a vacation in Canada. There's only one problem, the pets escape from the airport while being put in the cargo hold of the plane. Now their owners are in Canada and they're all alone in San Fransisco. They meet scruffy bully dogs and a gang of rebel dogs who are all abandoned and have started their own group. Also looking for them is a "Blood Red Van" driven by bumbling dogcatchers.â€”Dylan Self <robocoptng986127@aol.com>

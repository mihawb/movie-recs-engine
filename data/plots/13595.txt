The Lone Rangers are a heavy metal group consisting of vocalist/guitarist Chazz, bassist Rex, and drummer Pip. Despite their enthusiasm, the band is unable to get any producers to sign them on, much less listen to their demo tape.

However, the trio inadvertently draw the attention of the police, and a long standoff ensues.....â€”Sam

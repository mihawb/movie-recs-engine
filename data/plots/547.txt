It is a cold winter night. Grace MacLean (Scarlett Johansson) and her best friend Judith (Kate Bosworth) go for a ride with their horses, but a terrible accident changes their lives forever. A truck hits them, Judith and her horse are killed, while Grace and her horse Pilgrim are seriously injured, both physically and mentally. In an attempt to bring Pilgrim back from his now savage condition, Grace's mother Annie (Dame Kristin Scott Thomas) takes them to Montana in search of Tom Booker (Robert Redford). Tom is a "horse whisperer", a cowboy with the ability to "communicate" with horses. In the land of the Wild West, Annie will change the way she sees life forever, as the wise cowboy slowly heals the souls of Pilgrim and Grace.â€”Chris Makrozahopoulos <makzax@hotmail.com>

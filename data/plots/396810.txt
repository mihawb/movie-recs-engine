The affluent and cantankerous Harriet Lauler, the retired advertising entrepreneur who has made a fortune bossing everyone around to do things her way, decides it is high time she commissioned her own obituary. To make certain that her eulogy will be worthy of her position, the female perfectionist hires the reluctant local newspaper journalist, Anne Sherman, to do the job; however, keeping Harriet happy, is easier said than done. But, how will Harriet reshape the past when she has pushed so many people away? Clearly, there must be a way. After all, Harriet knows better.â€”Nick Riganas

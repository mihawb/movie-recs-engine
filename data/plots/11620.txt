After many years away at battle conquering other nations, Roman patrician Marcus Vinicius, returns to the city and accidentally meets a young Christian woman, who is the adopted daughter of a retired general but technically a hostage of Rome. He falls for her but she rebuffs his advances because of his warrior background and her newly found religion of Christianity. As time passes Marcus realizes that Ligia has a real devotion to this new religion and attempts to possess her completely by getting Nero to give her to him as a slave. Ligia escapes and hides out with a group of Christians and Marcus goes undercover to witness the devotion and reverence of the sect. Neros insane belief in his divinity runs rampant when he decides to burn Rome to get inspiration to write more beautiful songs, and ultimately to rebuild the city in his own image. Marcus barely rescues Ligia from the flames and when Nero realizes the citizens believe him responsible he shifts the blame to the Christians, rounds them up with Marcus and leads them to the arena to be devoured by Lions. Amidst all the activity Marcus realizes that he loves Ligia and that the new religion is taking hold in a way that can change history.

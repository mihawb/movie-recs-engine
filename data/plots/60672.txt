After a body is found in the walls of a French monastery, Commissioner Niemans, played by Jean Reno, once again teams up with his old partner, Detective Reda, played by Benoit Magimel, who was already investigating his own murder. As with the first movie, the pair's investigations intertwine and soon they are looking at a giant conspiracy involving a group of monks on steroids lead by Heinrich von Garten, played by Christopher Lee. Reno and Magimel are joined by a religious specialist called Marie, played by Camille Natta.

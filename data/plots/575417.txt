All it took was one long, passionate, late-night kiss on the lips to make novelist and mother-of-two Laura suspicious of her career-driven, high-reaching husband, Dean. Now, as the uncomfortable feelings of doubt and mistrust start creeping up on her, fanned by the horrible idea that the love of her life may be cheating on her, Laura reluctantly enlists the help of the impeccably dressed, semi-retired art dealer, Felix: her suave, mischievous, and effortlessly charming philanderer father. But, even though it is sometimes exhausting, we all want to be loved. And amid a persistent writer's block, Felix's innocent flirts with random women, Martini-fuelled lunches, and high-speed car chases in Manhattan's neon-lit streets, Laura needs to know. Is her life falling apart?â€”Nick Riganas

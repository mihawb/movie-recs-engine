On the sunny and seemingly ordinary Friday of January 13, 2006, the bohemian martial-arts instructor, Fernando Araujo, and his hand-picked four-member crew stormed into the branch of Banco Río in the affluent neighbourhood of Acassuso, Buenos Aires.

Now, five determined bank thieves along with twenty-three helpless hostages find themselves trapped in the building. Will the audacious robbers get away with the heist of the century?—Nick Riganas

Willing to unlock her family's history, orphaned ceramist Evie takes a DNA test. And not knowing what to expect, Evie is shocked to discover she has a distant cousin she never knew existed. As charming English relative Oliver Alexander offers Evie the chance to meet the rest of the family at a wedding in the clan's palatial estate at New Carfax Abbey, handsome host Walter De Ville sweeps the American guest off her feet, and Evie finds herself wondering. Is there more to enigmatic Walter than meets the eye? Why is Evie, and not the bride, the centre of attention?â€”Nick Riganas

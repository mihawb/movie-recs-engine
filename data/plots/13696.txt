Jerry escapes and later becomes a priest. After three years in prison, Rocky is released and charges his former partner, lawyer James Frazier, his US$100,000.00 and his share in the society, and is betrayed. Meanwhile, he becomes the idol of the street kids in the neighborhood. Although they follow opposite paths in life, Rocky and Jerry are still friends.

Giacomo meets Giovanni, his former best friend with whom he quarreled three years before. Giovanni persuades him to go visit their third friend Aldo, who is dying in Sicily; flashbacks tell their story: Aldo was the phantom in operas, Giacomo was dubbing films in which he only made noises, and Giovanni worked as a living department-store mannequin. Unsatisfied with their careers, they try to stage their own show but women troubles separate them.

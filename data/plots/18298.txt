The Three Kings are about to reach the stable where the baby Jesus has just been born when, by a strange miracle, they get caught in a space/time warp and find themselves transported to three distinct spots on the planet in 2001. Obeying Divine Will, the Three Kings continue on their mission that takes them to Paris, where they finally link up again. After endless complications, gags and misunderstandings, they meet Macha, Jo and Hoeder, respectively the Mary, Joseph and Herod of modern times. But will they find a new Messiah?

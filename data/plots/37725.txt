High school quarterback Woody Deane (Kevin Zegers of Transamerica) and Nell Bedworth (Samaira Armstrong of The O.C. and Entourage) are life long sworn enemies who wake up one day to find themselves in a very strange place: each other's bodies. Even if they can now survive their switched lives of girls' showers, boys' locker rooms, college interviews, the Homecoming football game and destroying each other's reputations, will they find that falling in love may be the ultimate out-of-body experience? Sharon Osbourne co-stars in this wild gender-bender comedy featuring a hot soundtrack of hits by Eminem, Black Eyed Peas, Elton John, James Blunt, Ozzy Osbourne, Girls Aloud, Mystikal and more!

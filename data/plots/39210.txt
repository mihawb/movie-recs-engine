Writer/director Sofia Coppolas film is an intimate story set in contemporary Los Angeles; Johnny Marco (Stephen Dorff) is a bad-boy actor stumbling through a life of excess (frenzied girls, booze and cars) at the Chateau Marmont Hotel, totally disconnected from the real life. With an unexpected visit from his 11-year-old daughter (Elle Fanning), Johnny is forced to look at the questions every father has to confront. Cleo surprisingly shows up and begins to grow fond of him, getting Johnnys connection to the real world to revive in her. As soon as Cleo leaves Marco is terribly lost but with the gift of being someone different. Coppola depicts a wonderful mood and atomosphere, the mellanchionic and spiritual touch being similar to the one of "Lost in Translation".

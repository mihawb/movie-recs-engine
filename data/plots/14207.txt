Flynn Carson is a thirty year old professional student with 22 degrees. Call him Uber-nerd. Booted out of his archaeological dig, he's invited to join The Metropolitan Library. He finds that his job requires more than checking books in and out. He's more a hunter for relics--but can't fight his way out of a paper bag. So the Library sends along a beautiful martial arts expert, Nichole (Sonya Walger) to protect him. The Library seeks a three part artifact, the Spear of Destiny. But so do the nefarious Serpent Brotherhood! Three countries later, trouble continues. But so does fun!

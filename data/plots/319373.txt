Burdened with a heavy and ever-increasing debt, Sentaro--the pensive baker of the popular red-bean confection, dorayaki--has no time to admire the alluring rain of petals in fragrant Tokyo, during the Cherry Blossom Season. But, to further complicate matters, one day, the kind ageing woman, Tokue, turns up at his small business, asking for a job. Of course, not being able to hire an employee--let alone the weary, Tokue--is the least of Sentaro's worries; however, when the cryptic woman returns the following day with her delicious surprise, the pastry cook will have no other choice but to accept her proposition. And just like that, little by little, Tokue's beautiful inner world unravels before a surprised Sentaro. Could Tokue be holding the secret not only to Sentaro's success but also to life's little pleasures?â€”Nick Riganas

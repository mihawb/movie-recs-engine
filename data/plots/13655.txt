Mitchie Torres (Demi Lovato) wakes up on her last day of school before summer. She really wants to go to a summer camp called 'Camp Rock'. Her mom tells her she can't afford it so she can't go. At school she's by her locker and her friend comes and starts speaking in Mandarin. She goes home and her parents say she is going to camp rock. This is because her mom got a job as a cook. Shane Gray (Joe Jonas) along with other band members Nate (Nick Jonas) and Jason (Kevin Jonas) arrive at Camp Rock to make Shane go to the camp and make himself behave, as Shane is a real jerk. At camp, Mitchie meets Caitlyn (Alyson Stoner), who she later befriends. She also meets 'camp diva' Tess Tyler (Meaghan Jette Martin), Peggy (Jasmine Richards) and Ella (Anna Maria Perez de Tagle). Mitchie is caught up in the world of Tess and her drama. During the film, Mitchie started to become a friend to Shane. Tess gets jealous of this friendship and keeps trying to break it up. Shane, while being stalked by fans, falls outside a room where Mitchie is practising a song. Mitchie doesn't know he's there and he doesn't know who is singing but loves it. Tess makes sure that Mitchie doesn't perform her song to Shane and others at the 'Final Jam', as they are a double act. They manage to anyway and then Shane find out that he was trying to find Mitchie all along. The kinda fall for each other but don't kiss.

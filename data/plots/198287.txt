In an international school in Jakarta, a philosophy class is having its last session. The professor challenges twenty-one graduating seniors to select ten who would take shelter underground for one year and then emerge to rebuild the human race following a nuclear attack. The students are each provided varying attributes, skills and professions that may or may not be deemed as valuable in reforming society one year following the attack. While the professor and individual students may have differing opinions regarding which skills and talents may be of the most value during the year underground and in rebuilding society after that year, one pivotal and timeless question is addressed. Which is more valuable to individuals, and thus society as a whole, Art or Science?

15-year-old Emile lives in Montargis between a sweet-crazy father and a mother who has always dyed his hair blond because "he is more beautiful like that." When the girl who pleases him more than anything invites him to Venice for the holidays, he is overjoyed--until his parents decide to accompany him. This is the story of a teenager born into an unclassifiable family; it's the story of a miraculous, fragile first love; it's the story of an initiatory, incredible journey where life often takes you unawares, but where Venice will be at the rendezvous. An adaptation of the novel Venice is Not in Italy by Ivan Calbérac, published by Flammarion in 2015.—StudioCanal

Betty Mahmoody is an American housewife living in America with her daughter and Iranian husband "Moody". Moody is very anxious to return to his homeland again, and wants to take his wife and daughter to Iran for a two week vacation. Betty expresses her doubts, but Moody assures her they would be fine, happy, and free to return anytime they want. But unfortunately, Betty's worst nightmare comes true as he has lied to her. Within time, Moody becomes more belligerent and abusive towards his wife and daughter, taking advantage of the Iranian laws. If Betty divorces Moody, he'll get full custody of their daughter, and her only salvation to return home is to escape with her daughter out of Iran.â€”Emphinix

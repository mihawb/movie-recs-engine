Mr. Hulot (Jacques Tati) takes his summer vacation at a seaside resort along with a gaggle of tourists and their children. When Hulot arrives at the resort he goes about his holiday by relaxing, and attempting to make friends with the stuffy regular tourists who take their summer holiday there. What ensues is an episodic view of the way a sense of social class obstructs the free exchange of new ideas and people. Hulot meets the young blonde Martine (Nathalie Pascaud) and successfully interacts with her socially but because of her class ties, she is barred from any real future. Hulot himself is classless and seems to only be able to find companionship at a funeral, but he maintains his positive view of life in spite of being relegated to sitting with the children on the beach.

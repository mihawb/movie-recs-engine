Sandy Ricks is sent by his mother to Coral Key, a rustic island in the Florida Keys, to spend the summer with his uncle, Porter Ricks. He dislikes everything about his new environment until a new friend, a dolphin named Flipper, comes into his life. It brings him and Porter together and leads him on the summer adventure of a lifetime.â€”Wayne Coleman <waynecoleman@swbell.net>

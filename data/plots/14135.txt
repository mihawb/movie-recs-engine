Under the false beliefs his mother has told him, Bubby, a 35-year-old man-child's convinced the only safe place safe is within the squalid, gloomy apartment, he shares with his controlling mother.. An unexpected visit from his long-estranged father sparks Bubby's insatiable curiosity to venture outside. As a result, Bubby sees a world radically transformed from the one he hazily recalls long ago, and likewise, the world's also not prepared for Bubby.â€”Nick Riganas

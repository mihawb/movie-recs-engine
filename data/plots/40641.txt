The intertwined stories, their connection unknown to the people involved, of a group of "les Nantais" are told, those stories of their hopes, dreams and aspirations especially in light of the unfulfilled or unsettled nature of their lives. These stories are centered on two people. The first is Roland Cassard, who considers himself the consummate failure. A perpetual daydreamer, he has just been fired from the latest in a long string of jobs despite being well-read. In light of that, he believes he is unable to find happiness in Nantes, despite not knowing what his future holds elsewhere. The second is Lola, a cabaret dancer and single mother to six year old Yvon. With the birth name Céline, Lola, somewhat flighty by nature, is going through the motions of life, which includes carousing with the sailors who frequent the cabaret, the latest being an American from Chicago named Frankie. Never expecting to see him ever again, she holds onto the memory of her first love Michel, Yvon's biological father who left seven years ago upon news of her pregnancy and who was off to find his fortune in whatever form that may have taken. Roland and Lola's dreams may be realized when they, childhood friends, run into each other and reconnect after not having seen each other in fifteen years. In light of Lola having been Roland's first love, something he never divulged to her at the time, they may change or want to change the less than perfect plans for their immediate futures which would have satisfied at least a small part of their aspirations.—Huggo

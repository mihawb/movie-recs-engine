Adorned with a magnificent protuberance that resembles a nose, Cyrano de Bergerac, a romantic, swaggering 17th-century Gascon swordsman, finds it difficult to express his love for beautiful Roxane. But, with his elongated nose standing in the way of happiness, Cyrano is shocked to discover that the love of his life has fallen for the handsome but shallow recruit to the Cadets de Gascogne, Christian de Neuvillette. As a result, convinced that he doesn't stand a chance against the dashing but inarticulate young suitor, Cyrano summons up the strength to step aside, and in a selfless act of kindness, decides to lend a hand with the delicate matters of love. Now, the sensitive poet's carefully chosen words become Christian's passionate declarations of love, and defenceless Roxane, who is oblivious of what has been going on behind her back, has no other choice but to fall madly in love with the silver-tongued author of the seductive billets-doux. Can love overcome the machinations of fate?â€”Nick Riganas

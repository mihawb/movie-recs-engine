Two prominent divorce attorneys begin to see each other in court, and sparks start flying. Audrey (Julianne Moore) and Daniel (Pierce Brosnan) see the worst part of failed marriages, which is why they have remained single. In court, they love to fight each other, each wanting so badly to win that they play dirty. One night, they are not thinking and they get married. While they did not mean to get married, they must pretend to the public that it was not a mistake. To save their careers, they decide to stay at Audrey's house, where Audrey starts showing affection toward Daniel, who discovers some information about Audrey's client (Michael Sheen), which Daniel accidentally uses in court, and feeling betrayed, Audrey asks for a divorce.

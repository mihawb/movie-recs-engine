A virus breaks out, resulting in a chilling massacre through the streets of Montevideo. The infected become hunters and only calm their fever by unscrupulously killing all those who have not caught the virus yet. Unaware of this, Iris and her daughter spend the day at the sports club where Iris works as a security guard. When night comes, she is about to start a merciless fight. Her only hope of salvation comes when they discover that after each attack the infected seem to fall into a 32-second trance of calmness and stillness before charging again.â€”exe_malaga93

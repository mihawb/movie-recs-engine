In March 1918, C-Company arrives to take its turn in the front-line trenches in northern France led by Captain Stanhope (Clafin). A German offensive is imminent, and the officers and their cook distract themselves in their dugout with talk of food and their past lives. Meanwhile, Stanhope soaks his fear in whisky. New young Officer Raleigh (Butterfield) has just arrived, abuzz with the excitement of his first real posting. Each man is trapped, the days ticking by, the tension rising and the attack drawing ever closer.

Bent on proving his worth and impress his one true love, Griselda Fishfinger, the wide-eyed cooper apprentice, Dennis, enters the impregnable gates of King Bruno the Questionable's medieval city. There, mud and terror enveil the citadel, as the very thought of an abominable nightmarish creature lurking somewhere outside the stronghold's towering walls strikes fear in the hearts of men. Under those dire circumstances, only a jousting contest can determine the realm's defender, and for the first time in a long while, ordinary Dennis is the master of his destiny. Now, immense riches and a glorious grand prize await the beast's slayer; however, can Dennis rid the walled city of the terrible dragon, the Jabberwocky?â€”Nick Riganas

Buzz Lightyear is an ultimate space ranger hero that must fight against his arch enemy the evil Emperor Zurg, who steals the "Unimind," a device that enables three-eyed aliens to function as a single intellect. The aliens, referred to as "LGMs" the little green men, form the support crew that keep Star Command running, but as individual thinkers, they're inept. Buzz acquires the sidekicks who form Team Lightyear: Booster, an oversize, overeager alien; XR short for "Experimental Ranger", one of the aliens' less successful robot inventions; and the inevitable spunky girl, Princess Mira Nova of the planet Tangeah. Together, this group of disparate heroes find they must work together to save the galaxy when Emporer Zurg hatches his grandest scheme for conquest yet and take on Emperor Zurg in intergalactic combat.â€”Anthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com}

A traveling circus has a wide variety of acts, including a number of sideshow curiosities based on some unusual physical attributes. They include midgets, limbless people, pinheads, conjoined twins, a bearded lady, and a half man/half woman. There are many interpersonal interactions between the entire troupe--generally amiable, but there are some who treat the curiosities as mere freaks. However, there are a few romantic relationships between the "normal" troupe members and the curiosities. One exception is the budding romantic relationship between Hans, a midget, and trapeze performer Cleopatra. Hans is unaware that Cleopatra only fosters that relationship because of the expensive gifts he lavishes on her; she is actually carrying on with muscle man Hercules, physically the antithesis of Hans. Fellow midget Frieda, who was once engaged to Hans and still loves him, believes that Cleopatra's interest in Hans is solely to make fun. But Frieda inadvertently provides Cleopatra with some information which changes Cleopatra's resolve instead to marry Hans. Hans' fellow sideshow curiosities do anything necessary to protect their dignity and that of one of their own.â€”Huggo

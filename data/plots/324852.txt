Balthazar Bratt (Trey Parker), a child star from the 1980s, rises to power and wants world domination. As Gru (Steve Carell) and Lucy Wilde (Kristen Wiig) attempt to stop him from stealing the largest diamond in the world, they fail as he flies away. Gru and Lucy are fired by Valerie Da Vinci (Jenny Slate) from the Anti-Villain League, and are jobless. As Agnes (Nev Scharrel) tries to sell things to get money, Gru receives news he has a twin brother. He flies to Dru's (Steve Carell's) location, but finds out he is a more successful and rich supervillain. Dru wants Gru to team up for one more heist, to which he gives in. Without Lucy knowing, they plan to steal the largest diamond in the world from Bratt, as the Minions get themselves in prison.â€”kenamwilliam

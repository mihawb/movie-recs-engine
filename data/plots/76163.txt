After a successful rescue mission of a Chinese millionaire in Nepal, CIA Church (Bruce Willis) meets Barney Ross and asks him to travel with his team to Albania to retrieve the content of a safe in a plane that has crashed. Church sends the specialist Maggie to go with them. Soon they find the plane and Maggie takes a box from the safe, but while returning to the plane, they find that their sniper Billy The Kid (Liam Hemsworth) has been captured by a group of men under the command of Vilain (Jean-Claude Van Damme). He asks them to put the weapons on the ground and deliver him the box; otherwise, he would kill the hostage. Barney and his group do exactly what was ordered but Villain kills Billy the Kid before leaving in a helicopter. Barney asks Maggie what was inside the box and she tells that it shows the location of a large mine of Russian plutonium. Now Barney and his men decide to track down Villain and his group known as The Sangs and kill them.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

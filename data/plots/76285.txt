After preventing the destructive war between Zeus and Poseidon in Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief (2010), Percy struggles to make his mark at Camp Half-Blood. To prove his worth, Percy and a handful of demigod friends embark on an epic, peril-laden quest to defend humans, heading straight to the edge of mythology: the dangerous Sea of Monsters. As the teenage protectors leave no stone unturned to find the fabled, magical Golden Fleece, a formidable adversary from the past plots revenge. But time is running out. Can Percy Jackson heal the great Barrier and save the world?â€”Nick Riganas

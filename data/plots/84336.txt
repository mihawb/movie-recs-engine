Colette McVeigh: widow, mother, terrorist. A woman who has lived the Republican cause for all her 29 years. A woman whose brothers are both heavily involved at the senior levels in the IRA, whose husband was killed by the British security forces. A woman who is now an informer for MI5. Arrested in an aborted bombing attempt in London, Colette is given two choices: talk and see her children again, or stay silent and spend the rest of her life watching them grow up from behind the bars of a prison cell.

Ambitious LA cop with Latin temper moves to Internal Affairs department where he's paired up with lesbian superior. Immediately involved in police brutality case, his pursuit of the young police officer leads him to cross swords with an amoral, possibly sociopathic police sergeant who controls a seemingly department wide network of corruption. Physical and pychological battle between them involving violence, murder and some, occasionally rough, sex ends in triumph for the good guys as usual but with some thought provoking character exploration along the way as the film develops. Sympathethic treatment of the gay female IA officer ahead of its time.

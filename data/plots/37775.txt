Three Italians must travel from their current residences to vote in local elections in their hometowns. Pasquale is an Italian living in Munich, Germany and must vote in Matera, Basilicata in the south of Italy. He's genuinely happy to return to Italy, even if just for a few days, but the country he is dreaming of is different from the reality he meets. Furio must travel from Torino to Roma with his whole family, at a time when his wife Magda is thinking of escaping from him. Mimmo is a nice young man traveling from Verona to Roma; he is disturbed by worries about her health although she is very calm.â€”1felco

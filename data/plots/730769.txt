Pascal and his wife Sophie have been running a small local butcher's shop for about twenty years. Sophie stands with great love for her customers at the cash register and Vincent cuts the carefully selected meat with just as much love. And they lived happily ever after, you might think. But then, as is the case with many small tradesmen, business went downhill and so did their relationship. After almost 30 years of marriage, the marriage bed is as alive as the sausages in the counter. Mutual irritation hinders any form of dialogue. Love, business - nothing works out, so Sophie seeks refuge in her great passion: TV shows about serial killers. Vincent unleashes all his love on Pépère, his gentle rottweiler/pitbull.—Jakkepoes

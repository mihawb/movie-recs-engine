Milo Tindle, a struggling actor and a chauffeur, doesn't know what to expect when he comes to visit the rich and successful mystery novelist, Andrew Wyke. After all, he is stealing Andrew's wife. His first surprise is learning that the comfortable old English country house is, on the inside, cold and stark and filled with monitors, cameras and other surveillance devices. Its owner, Andrew, lays a thin sheen of civility over his malicious and insulting chatter, and then he gets down to business. That's Milo's second surprise. Andrew claims he wants to be rid of his now-detested wife. But if Andrew agrees to give his wife a divorce and hand her over to Milo, he expects something in return. Andrew has just made the first move in a game of cat and mouse that may prove to be deadly.â€”J. Spurlin

With the intention of finally seeing the naked body of a real woman, three 12-year-old best friends who pooled their milk money, Frank, Brad and Kevin leave the quiet suburb of Middletown to bicycle to the nearest big city, anxious to see a willing woman take off her clothes. As a result, it is not before long when V, a prostitute with a heart of gold, agrees, however, when her car breaks down while driving the friends home, V will soon realise that maybe the inconspicuous suburban town is the perfect hideout. But as V becomes indispensable in the lives of Frank and his widower father, Tom, inevitably, the past will abruptly catch up with her, putting in jeopardy young Frank's secret plan. Can now V get a second chance at love in the small community?â€”Nick Riganas

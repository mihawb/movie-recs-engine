Brightmoor, Detroit. On a chilly night pouring with rain, young Tess drives into the unknown, ill-lit neighbourhood and parks outside her Airbnb on 476 Barbary Street. Now, more than anything, Tess wants to hit the sack--after all, she has a busy day tomorrow. Instead, unsuspecting Tess is in for a shock when she realises the letting agent has double-booked the house. And as mysterious Keith tries to understand, doing his best to break the ice and right the wrong, Tess is about to discover that there are a million reasons to be afraid of the dark.â€”Nick Riganas

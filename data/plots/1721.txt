Somewhere in South America, the fearless bush-flying duo, Plata and Salud, seem to have come up with the perfect and fail-proof scheme to make easy money, faking plane crashes to collect the insurance. However, there's no such thing as a flawless plan, and pretty soon, the cunning pilots will have a taste of their own medicine, when their aircraft crash-lands--this time, for real--in the heart of the wild Peruvian jungle, where the unscrupulous speculator, Mr Ears, controls a precious emerald source. With a whole village and an entire mining community under the heavy thumb of the ruthless criminal kingpin, can Plata and Salud right the wrongs, and in the process, manage to make a profit?â€”Nick Riganas

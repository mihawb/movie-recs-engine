Immature, cheap douchebag Fábio Clóvis marries pseudo-intellectual Miá and they take a honeymoon cruise to Europe aboard a fancy passenger vessel. Fabio and Miá are invited to have dinner with the wealthy Beto Assunção and his gorgeous wife Laura in a VIP restaurant on the ship. Soon Fábio discovers that Beto was Miá's boyfriend and Miá learns that Fábio had a crush on Laura when they were classmates. Meanwhile, cynical chambermaid Suzana Mello and her estranged husband, entertainer Wilson, make a bet that Fábio and Miá will split before the end of the trip, then try to poison their relationship. When the ship arrives in Casablanca, Fábio meets his bothersome childhood friend Cabeça; this affects their honeymoon.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

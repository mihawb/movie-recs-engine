It's no secret that The Boss Baby (2017) isn't fond of Christmas and the Templetons' traditions. But with Christmas Eve just around the corner, Baby is in for a big surprise when he accidentally finds himself stranded in the frozen North Pole with Santa's elves. As things get crazy, with Baby going into boss mode, it's up to Tim to get his younger brother back home on time to celebrate the Templetons' favourite holiday together. Will the Templetons save Christmas?â€”Nick Riganas

An old man dies. Looking through his papers, his grand-daughter realises that he had fought in the Spanish Civil War. As a young Communist Party member, he (David) had gone to Spain in 1936 to fight the fascists. He joined the POUM militia which was allied to the militias of other left-wing groups. But the idealism of David and his friends was tested to its limit as their comrades were killed and the alliance disintegrated. The old man is buried. Was his struggle in vain?â€”<P.M.Laws@education.leeds.ac.uk>

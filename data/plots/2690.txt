In the vibrant Les Halles food-market, at the bustling red-light district of rue Casanova, business is booming for the delicate Parisian streetwalker, Irma. Infatuated with her, the zealous but penniless former police officer, Nestor Patou, will soon find himself dragged into an unknown world when he accepts Irma's generous invitation to move into her apartment. Little by little--as the young gendarme learns the tricks of the trade, first by becoming Irma's procurer, and then, by becoming the king of the block's pimps--an unexpected love affair will begin; however, Nestor's justifiable jealousy gets the best of him. Now, Irma thinks that Nestor is cheating on her. To what extremes would Nestor have to go, to prove his love for sweet Irma?â€”Nick Riganas

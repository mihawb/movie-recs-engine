New York detective Jacob Kanon has a daughter. A beautiful, talented daughter who is brutally murdered as she honeymoons in blissful ignorance. Soon after, the strangest of postcards arrives on the desk of Swedish art critic Dessie Larsson... Across Europe, couples are being ruthlessly butchered in deliberate acts of violence with no end in sight. The only clues, are picture postcards sent to seemingly random journalists by a narcissistic killer, heralding the next horrific crime. Seen from the joint perspective of both the hunted and the hunters, THE POSTCARD KILLINGS digs deep into the most frightening aspects of the human psyche, drawing Jacob and Dessie into a nightmare from which there might be no escape. As the narrative explodes with operatic ferocity, our protagonists find themselves with an impossible choice to make.â€”Anonymous

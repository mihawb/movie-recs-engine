In a puff of smoke, Adolf Hitler resurfaces, inexplicably, in present-day Berlin, disoriented and dressed in full regalia. Unable to locate his bunker, Nazi Germany's notorious leader meanders through the once-familiar city's now completely unknown streets, mingling with a motley crew of strangers who, incomprehensibly, show a brazen and blatant disrespect to his authority.

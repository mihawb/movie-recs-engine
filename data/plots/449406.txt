Vivo follows a one-of-kind kinkajou (aka a rainforest "honey bear") who spends his days playing music to the crowds in a lively square with his beloved owner Andrés. Though they don't speak the same language, Vivo and Andrés are the perfect duo through their common love of music. But when tragedy strikes shortly after Andrés receives a letter from the famous Marta Sandoval, inviting her old partner to her farewell concert with the hope of reconnecting, it's up to Vivo to deliver a message that Andrés never could: A love letter to Marta, written long ago, in the form of a song. Yet in order to get to Marta, who lives a world away, Vivo needs help from Gabi, an energetic tween who bounces to the beat of her own offbeat drum, to fulfill his owner's wishes.—Netflix

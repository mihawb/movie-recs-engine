Aida, a local teacher-turned-interpreter working at a Dutch-run UN base near the town of Srebenica in 1995 Bosnia, finds herself with her back to the wall. As the Serbian army takes over, and the gun-toting men of General Ratko Mladic close in on the allegedly safe zone of Srebenica, thousands of Bosnians flock into the base camp begging for shelter, including Aida's family. Now, against the backdrop of false promises, bureaucracy, confusion, and fruitless, white-knuckle negotiations in the name of peace, Aida risks everything to protect her husband and two sons. But time is running out, and desperate Aida is looking for logic where there is none. Where are you going, Aida?â€”Nick Riganas

Arriving in the Lombard metropolis, not knowing where to stay, he asks for help from his cousin Severino, who has long since moved to the city, who offers him hospitality and work; Artemio accepts, but does not know that Severino is actually a thief who enters and leaves prison and who, unbeknownst to him, immediately involves him in mugging. Once he realizes this, he abandons his cousin and decides to return the booty of the latest theft to its rightful owner, Angela, a young and beautiful career girl.A friendship is born between the two and the girl also finds him a place to stay, a small, expensive and technological studio apartment in an aseptic residence. At this point Artemio devotes himself to looking for a job: he tries to be an insurer, a night watchman, an actor in commercials and even a friend for the blind, but always without success. Eventually he finds himself inexorably unemployed and penniless. In the meantime he realizes that he has fallen in love with Angela, so much so that he proposes to marry him after a night spent together, but the girl refuses, declaring herself modern and too busy with work, therefore not interested in taking such a step.

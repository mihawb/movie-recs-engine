Wallace Ritchie (Bill Murray), an American vacationer in London, England, doesn't know that the bullets are real and the truth serum true. He thinks the intrigue erupting around him is part of an audience-participation theater event. Yet the world's fate depends on this gullible goofus who can't even spell C.I.A. Ritchie is the naive spy who comes in very bold. The deadpan Ritchie blissfully treads into a deadly serious realm. He can't believe how believable the make-believe seems. But as Ritchie's cloak-and-dagger experiences with agents, a femme fatale, a corpse, highway pursuits (lesson number one: drive on the left), assassins, and a ticking time bomb amply prove, variety isn't just the spice of life. It's the life of spies.â€”Robert Lynch <docrlynch@yahoo.com>

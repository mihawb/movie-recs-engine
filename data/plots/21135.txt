After an all-night discussion of their relationship issues, Vittoria leaves the apartment of her long-time fiancé Riccardo, for good. She tells him she no longer loves him, but she can't really express her feelings, most specifically why, beyond that. Riccardo accepts the news, but doesn't like it. Vittoria visits her mother at the Stock Exchange, where she spends the better part of her time monitoring her stocks, and meets her stockbroker Piero, a driven young man. They are physically attracted to each other and Piero pursues her doggedly, especially after a disastrous day on the market. She is physically attracted to him also, though she pushes him away when he gets physically close. She eventually does let him into her life. During their burgeoning relationship, they tell each other one thing, however their actions may tell a slightly different story.—Huggo

A visionary sheik believes his passion for the peaceful pastime of salmon fishing can enrich the lives of his people, and he dreams of bringing the sport to the not so fish-friendly desert. Willing to spare no expense, he instructs his representative to turn the dream into reality, an extraordinary feat that will require the involvement of Britain's leading fisheries expert who happens to think the project both absurd and unachievable. That is, until the Prime Minister's overzealous press secretary latches on to it as a 'good will' story. Fred works to implement the project with Harriet and the sheik. He gradually begins to believe the sheik's quest. Fred begins to fall in love with Harriet, and she must choose between two men. The fish project seems to be a success, but is sabotaged by local militants. However, some fish survive and so Fred continues to fulfill the sheik's vision.

Two-time OscarÂ® winner Robert De Niro teams up with Uma Thurman and Bill Murray in this wildly offbeat, adventure-filled love story that proves when trouble comes, anything goes. When shy, soft-spoken Chicago detective Wayne "Mad Dog" Dobie (De Niro) inadvertently saves the life of local gangster Frank Milo (Murray), he's the reluctant recipient of an unusual one week "thank you" gift - a beautiful bartender named Glory (Thurman). Before the week is out, the two have fallen madly in love, making for a murderous showdown with Milo. Now Dobie must live up to his ironic nickname or it will be "no guts, no Glory" in this heartwarming comedy.

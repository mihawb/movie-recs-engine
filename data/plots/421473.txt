Based on real-life events, this is a bombshell of a movie which centers around a young, success-driven, fresh-out-of-the academy F.B.I. Agent who is sent to Pikeville, a beleaguered mining town in rural Kentucky, where he takes up his first assignment: investigating a chop-shop ring and various other illegal activities. Once ensconced in his work, Putnam gets way too involved with a down-on-her-luck local woman who becomes his star informant. The events that transpire will shake the small mining community to its core, and ultimately alter the lives of all involved for untold years to come.â€”Marilee Griffin

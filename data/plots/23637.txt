Divorced teacher Marco Sperelli is sent to work in Corzano, a town near Naples. The first day of work he finds in the school only the caretaker and a few girls and boys in the classroom. He goes out looking for the rest and discovers that the boys and girls of Corzano live a wretched life in which only power and violence are worth respecting. Sperelli tries to teach something different but he gets their respect only by slapping Raffaele, a budding Camorrist. His presence and work, however, disturb too many people, who wish for him to be transferred.â€”Baldinotto da Pistoia

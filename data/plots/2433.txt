Romantics at heart, twin sisters Delphine and Solange Garnier work in the performing arts. While they are multi-talented in that regard, Delphine wants to become a dancer while Solange a composer, but with no real such opportunities in their hometown of Rochefort, they earn a living by teaching dance and music to children. As such, they believe they are only able to achieve their performing arts and romantic dreams by moving to Paris. Delphine's want to leave is also to escape her ex-boyfriend, art gallery owner Guillaume Lancien, who makes no bones about wanting to get back together with her. While they never knew their father, Delphine and Solange are the elder offspring of Yvonne Garnier, who owns and operates the café in the town square. They also have a much younger half brother, adolescent Booboo Garnier, the product of Yvonne's second love with who she has lost contact. As Delphine and Solange prepare to leave for Paris after this current weekend, they are unaware that the stars are in alignment for their dreams to happen in Rochefort for a fleeting moment as many of the players are only in town temporarily: Etienne and Bill, who are the lead performers in a traveling fair; naval sailor Maxence, who, seeing himself as an artist and poet, can visualize the love of his life without ever having met her; and American concert pianist and composer Andy Miller, who has come to town, a side trip from his current concert tour stop in Paris, to visit an old friend, Simon Dame, the music shop owner, he himself only recently having moved to Rochefort to relive a memory. While the people are in place for the Garniers in Rochefort for this short period, the stars may have other thoughts for them.—Huggo

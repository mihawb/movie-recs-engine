Hilarity ensues when Monsieur Brochant is tipped off to a particularly eccentric matchstick artist, the bumbling but good-natured Pignon. Excited and na√Øve, Pignon is hoodwinked into joining the dinner gamethe promise of a book deal on his matchstick models is offered as baitbut when Brochant throws his back out the buffoon arrives, becoming the sole caregiver to the incapacitated would-be predator. In Pignons incompetent care Brochant is hurt, over and over again, physically, romantically, and emotionallyan ironic twist in the fact that he was supposed to be the one dishing out the pain. With a wrecked romantic life, a luxurious apartment up for unintentional audit, a hurt back, and an irate disposition, Brochants life cant seem to get any worstuntil he hears word his wife was in an accident. This unfortunate situation presents him with a final attempt to reconcile with his wife, though she wont take his calls. In desperation he enlists the divorced Pignon to share his true story of betrayal, heartache, loss, and depression with Mrs. Brochantan act that nearly succeeds, but like most things with Pignon, are obliviously unintentionally foiled.

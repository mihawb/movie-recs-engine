It's the early 1990s. Modeled after the original in New York City, ACT UP Paris is an AIDS activist group which lobbies the government, its agencies and big pharma among others in positions of power to affect effective change to assist those that have contracted HIV specifically with regard to the virus itself. While anyone can join if they abide by the organization guidelines, which espouses non-violent action and respect for all members especially in how they conduct their weekly meetings, members are told up front that they should present themselves as HIV+, which many if not most are regardless. With time not on their side with many potentially and imminently succumbing to the virus, they often resort to guerrilla tactics, such as storming AIDS conferences and the offices of those in power, to get their message across. These tactics often lead to internal disagreements which are not always resolved amicably. From these macro activities of the organization, the story moves to a micro scale of the burgeoning relationship between two members. The first is HIV+ founding member Sean, who got infected on his first sexual experience ten years ago with a man he loved when he was sixteen. The second is HIV- Nathan, for who AIDS has always been in the back of his mind in his actions, but never in the front of his mind in not ever knowing conclusively the HIV status of his sexual partners, that is until now.â€”Huggo

When the manic Dr Robotnik returns to Earth with a new ally, Knuckles the Echidna. Sonic and his new friend Tails is all that stands in their way. Sonic is back with a boom, this is by far the most entertaining of all video game adaptions in history. It was great to see Jim Carrey reprise his role of Dr Robotnik, he plays the role so well the first time and this time he does it even better. There were so many moments within this piece of cinema that hit me with memories from the video games, I think the director done a fantastic job and he definitely had some Sonic Adventure knowledge. A great family film for all the kids to love and those like me who grew up playing Sonic on the dreamcast/Nintendo, these past couple of years have activated alot of nostalgia among the art of film. Highly Recommend this incredible follow up to the Blue Justice himself. 10/10â€”BrnzReviews

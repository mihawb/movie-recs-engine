Returning from a hunting trip in the forest, the Henderson family's car hits something in the road. At first, they fear it was a man, but when they examine his "body", they find he's a "bigfoot". They think he's dead, so they decide to take him home. As you guessed, he isn't dead. Far from being the ferocious monster they fear him to be, he's a friendly giant. In their attempts to keep him a secret, they have to hide him from the authorities and a man who has made his goal in life to catch a "bigfoot".â€”Rob Hartill

In the spirit of the samurai, imbued with the ancient wisdom of the Hagakure, stealthy and taciturn Ghost Dog, a masterful contract killer who is at the top of his game, has pledged his loyalty to Louie, a middle-ranking mobster who had once saved his life. However, after an unforeseen complication during a mission, the local mafia boss, Vargo, and his associate, Sonny Valerio, decide that Ghost Dog has become a liability to the crime syndicate and order his execution. Now, as the dead bodies start piling up, the hunted hitman must make the most crucial decision of his career. Will he stay faithful to his master and the way of the samurai to the bitter end?â€”Nick Riganas

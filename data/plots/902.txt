On a mist-shrouded rig in the sea, beyond an old minefield, Krank (Daniel Emilfork) ages prematurely because he lacks one vital function: the ability to dream. And so he kidnaps children from the harbour town, to steal their happy dreams from them. But a child he takes is also the little brother of carnival strongman One (Ron Perlman), who sets out to rescue him with the help of his precocious young, orphaned friend Miette (Judith Vittet).

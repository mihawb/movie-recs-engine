Stage fright leads Alice down a rabbit hole, through a looking glass, and into a pool of tears in Wonderland. Here she meets the oddest creatures imaginable, where doors lead into trees and claustrophobic halls where you shrink to three inches or grow to ten feet and get stuck in a vault. You can take tea with a Mad Hatter, play croquet with the Queen of Hearts, listen to singing trees and talking flowers, or get advice from a hallucinating veteran caterpillar. But everything has a purpose, and the one here is to make Alice confident; it's not all fun and games.

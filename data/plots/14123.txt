Four best friends start high school. Each one is unique and likes their own thing; Chloe joins the soccer team, Sasha joins the cheer leading squad, Jade is part of the math club. While the other girls hang out with their chosen crowds, Yasmin is left all alone. When Meredith, the most popular girl, sees this she automatically knows they are trouble. After years of not talking to each other Jade and Yasmin speak a few words in the restroom but Yasmin doesn't have the courage to tell Jade she misses her. The four girls are reunited when they are sent to detention for causing a food fight. The reunited foursome find out they are not invited to a huge party given by Meredith. Worse, Chloe finds out that her mom has a job serving food at the party. They are forced to work for Meredith. At the party, Meredith decides to expose Yasmin's secret (her dancing and singing with a face mask.) When Yasmin's brother starts doing a dance and everybody joins in, Meredith is humiliated. When Meredith accidentally gets thrown into the pool she calls the four best friends "bratz." The girls decide to be part of the talent show to win a scholarship. Meredith is always the one who wins, yet the "bratz" are prepared to take her down. Meredith renews her threats to Yasmin; if she continues preparing for the show, Meredith will expose her friend's secrets. Yasmin decides to call everything off. In the end, the girls do the talent show, and boldly tell everybody their secrets which turn out not to be so bad after all. The girls win and each end up with their respective crushes. The girls decide to give Chloe the scholarship. The movie ends with the girls walking down a red carpet.â€”cely

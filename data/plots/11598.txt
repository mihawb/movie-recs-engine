This movie is out of control. There aren't any spoilers in here because the movie doesn't actually have an ending. It can't because Kentucky Fried Movie is a collection of (I say) short films. Every one of them is Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker literal humor with a site gag to go along with every line. I loved it. I watch it frequently because you can watch a segment and watch another one later. I was surprised when I realized it came out in 1977. It's a potential stoner movie - I'm surprised it didn't come out in 1972.

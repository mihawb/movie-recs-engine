Three years after the events in Nim's Island, the island faces a new challenge. The operators of the ship Buccaneer have gotten permission to develop a pirate resort on the island, and Nim (Bindi Irwin) and her father pursue separate plans to stop them. Meanwhile, a city boy named Edmund (Toby Wallace), who has met Nim once before and decides to see her again, has run away from home to the island, inadvertently bringing poachers with him. With her father, Jack Rusoe (Matthew Lillard) away on the mainland, Nim must learn to work with Edmund in order to save the island from the poachers.

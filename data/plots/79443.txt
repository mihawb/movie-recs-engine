As the cheerful Smurfs get ready for the longed-for Christmas Eve party, Grouchy Smurf is in no mood for decorating or celebrating. To help him see the error of his ways, wise Papa Smurf concocts a potent potion, and as if by magic, the Smurf of Christmas Past appears in his house in the shape of beautiful Smurfette. Before long, the Smurf of Christmas Present follows, and then the Smurf of Christmas Future shows up at Grouchy's door. However, can the benevolent spirits help Grouchy get into the Christmas spirit?â€”Nick Riganas

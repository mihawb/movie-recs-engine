Cannes, France. Suffering from an earache, Anne can't accompany her affectionate but workaholic Hollywood producer husband, Michael, to Paris. Instead, Anne unexpectedly takes a long road trip through France with Michael's French colleague, Jacques, who has volunteered to take her by car to the City of Lights, where Michael will meet her. However, as they drive across the picturesque French countryside, bonding over light-hearted conversations, two perfect strangers gradually find deeper meaning in life, one gastronomical delight at a time. After all, Paris can wait.â€”Nick Riganas

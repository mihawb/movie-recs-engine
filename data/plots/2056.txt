Finbar McBride (Peter Dinklage) is a train fanatic who inherits an abandoned train station in New Jersey. He moves into the station and makes it his new home. Fin wants to live a life of seclusion in this rural town, because he is only 4 feet 5 inches tall, and he has been stared at all his life. Soon, Fin has a run-in with several of the local people. He meets Joe (Bobby Cannavale) who has a van parked outside his station selling coffee, cokes, ice cream and hot dogs. Fin gets some coffee and tries to keep his business quiet and not speak to Joe. Fin starts walking towards town when a local artist Olivia (Patricia Clarkson) almost runs him over twice with her SUV during his first day. With people like this bugging you, no wonder Fin wants to be left alone. In town, the storekeeper takes his picture, and Fin knows that things haven't changed. The vendor and the artist develop an uncertain friendship with Fin, and they begin to do things together. Fin wanted to become an independent man in this town, but instead he makes friends and connects with some of the town's people.

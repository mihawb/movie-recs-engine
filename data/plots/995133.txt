Determined to find his way home, a lost boy meanders through the snow-covered wilderness on a chilly spring day. And not knowing where to begin, the inquisitive lad crosses paths with a cake-loving mole, a stealthy red fox, and a wise white horse harbouring a surprising secret. As the unlikely companions travel across vast silent landscapes to find the boy a place he can call home, they share their intimate fears, positive affirmations, and loving thoughts. But the journey is long and challenging. Are the pale, flickering lights in the distance the answer to the boy's prayers?â€”Nick Riganas

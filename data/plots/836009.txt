Danish arctic expedition Alabama in 1909 was performed to proof that Greenland was one island and therefore belonged to Denmark and not to the United States. The US claimed the North Eastern part of Greenland, based on the idea that Greenland consisted of two different sections of land. Danish Captain Ejnar Mikkelsen embarks on a journey across the ice in Greenland with his new crew member, Iver Iversen. The two men are trying to find the proof that Greenland was one island. While they are fighting extreme hunger, exhaustion and polar bear attacks, they finally arrive back to find their ship abandoned and crushed in the ice. Their only hope at this moment is surviving the cold, starvation and paranoia while they wait for rescue.â€”Frank Liesenborgs <frank.liesenborgs@gmail.com>

Twelve-year-old Anna believes she sits outside the invisible magic circle to which most people belong, and shuts herself off from everyone around her. Concerned for her health, Anna's foster mother decides to send her to rural Hokkaido to stay in a sleepy town by the sea. There she meets Marnie, an energetic young girl who seems to appear from nowhere. The pair quickly become inseparable.

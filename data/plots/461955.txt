After a sudden and utterly devastating attack by the Klum, the technologically superior reptilian alien race, the Earth of the not-so-distant 2020 suffers from extensive terraforming, severe atmosphere altering--and above all--an almost complete extinction of humanity. With the last resilient survivors scattered over a nearly dead planet, mankind's last hope rests in a heroic resistance movement and in the hands of its leader, Jasper; however, before the hordes of the brutal and seemingly unstoppable extraterrestrials, the future is bleak. Is there a way to end the genocide?â€”Nick Riganas

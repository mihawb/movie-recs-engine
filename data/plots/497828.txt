Having to learn to live with his bruised male pride after a disastrous career-defining audition, young fashion model Carl has an all-night row with his successful influencer model/girlfriend, Yaya. But with money remaining a touchy subject, Carl is fighting a losing battle. As a result, insecurities, fragile egos, artful manipulation, and silent gender expectations shed light on every nook and cranny of their modern relationship. Then, politeness eventually prevails, and Yaya takes Carl on a sun-kissed luxury cruise to rub shoulders with the ultra-rich. But life isn't Instagram. And before long, a raging tempest violently rocks the multimillion-dollar yacht back and forth like a see-saw, getting the best of plutocrats and workers alike. Now, let's see who has the upper hand. Will the dazed passengers ever escape the triangle of sadness?â€”Nick Riganas

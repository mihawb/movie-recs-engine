Without a doubt, beautiful, well-endowed Alison is going through a rough patch in her life. On the one hand, her bossy mother, Sylvia, is suffocating her, and on the other hand, Alison's had enough of pervy eyes glued to her F-sized breasts every day. To spare herself further embarrassment, Alison schedules an appointment at a seedy Eastern European clinic for a cheap breast reduction surgery, and without delay, off she goes along with her supportive boyfriend, Michael, and of course, surgery-addicted Sylvia. Then, after a bizarre first impression, unsuspecting Michael comes face-to-face with pure horror and the hospital's well-hidden secret, and no one will ever be the same again. Now, there is no turning back. Is there an escape from the blood-stained temple of beauty?â€”Nick Riganas

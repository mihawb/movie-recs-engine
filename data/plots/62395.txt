Marcelino is a young boy who lives with monks in a Monastery. One monk told Marcelino never to go up the stairwell of the onastery. But, Marcelino went upstairs, out of curiosity to see what was there. He sees a a big crucifix in the room, and puts out bread andwine, and miraculously, Jesus appears, comes down from the cross and eats. He talks to Marcelino, said he was a good boy, and told Marcelino he could have one wish. Marcelino wishes to see Jesus' mother, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and Marcelino's mother. Jesus says he has to fall asleep in order to get his wish. Marcelino falls asleep on Jesus' arm. Marcelino bears the vision of The Blessed Virgin and his mother. The monks then realize that Jesus came down to talk with the boy, and believe it was a true miracle. Jesus gave the boy the name "Marcelino Pan y Vino": "Bread and Wine."

Three women and four men: Everyone has a mobile phone, which makes a total of seven mobile phones. When the friends come together for dinner one evening, they suddenly come up with an idea for a game: Everyone puts their cell phone in the middle of the table and no matter who gets which pictures or messages sent, no matter how brief, everything must be shared with the others. Telephone calls are only allowed via the loudspeaker. But what starts as an entertaining pastime to bring a little tension to the evening, soon leads to embarrassing and tense situations full of surprises. Soon, not only does the mood threaten to tilt, but also the long-standing relationships are at stake through the discovery of explosive lies and secrets.

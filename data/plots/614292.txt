This movie is dark and surreal, and supposedly based on the narrative which was found in a young girls discarded diary, the facts of the written daily entries may, or may not be, true ...... Like the entries in the diary, the movie builds momentum in a series of two minute clip-bites which is difficult to synpo .... The story is about a modern looking suburb inhabited by families who have pubescent children varying in ages of around 8 to 13, all of whom are savvy to the adult world thanks to the crass behavior and "trailer-park-trash" antics of their parents who routinely swear, cuss, and talk uninhibited adult-talk in front of their children. One sole parent father is so blindly irresponsible, he teaches his 12yo son to drive their beat-up old car, offers him condoms when he know he has a girlfriend ('just-in-case'), and allows him to drink beer. The film focuses on a core group of a handful of children who see the futility of the lives of their parents, and thanks to a deranged school teacher, the children learn how to manufacture two crude and unstable yet seemingly powerful home-made bombs, and how and where to purchase cheap insecticide, which is a potent nervous-system debilitating poison .......... although the bombs are discovered before they are set off, all the background dark undertones eventually hold sway. This dark story ends with the sole-parent father and his son breaking free of their depressing rut, while some of the other children who remain in the suburb take their own lives .... but then the narrator reminds us the bleak events which bring this sad story to a close are based on the words written in a young girls diary .... the facts of which may ... or may-not be ... true

Sydney White has grown up amongst construction workers ever since her mother died (when she was 9). She earns a scholarship for college and hopes to follow in the footsteps of her mother and enter the Kappa sorority. When she realized the sorority life wasn't for her, she moved out of the house and moved into "The Vortex,"(Which is called Vortex because it sucks in losers) a house on Greek Row for people who don't belong. There, she meets 7 dorks (the 7 dwarves). She realizes what great people they are, and she gets one of them, Terrance, to run for Student Body President in order to take back what the Greeks have had for so long. When those dreams are denied (Terrance has already graduated), Sydney runs for president herself.If you've seen Revenge of the Nerds, all the way down to the line "I'm in love with a nerd/dork", then you've seen this movie already.

Having suffered a severe injury while serving in Afghanistan as part of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, emotionally scarred Lynsey returns to her home town of New Orleans to recuperate. And as the heavily medicated former officer struggles to find purpose outside rehab and the military, working hard to reclaim her life, Lynsey strikes up an unexpected relationship with sweet-natured local mechanic James, a broken soul offering companionship. But Lynsey is itching to redeploy to find her place in the world. When well-buried traumas stand in the way of new beginnings, can time take the edge off the pain and heal the open wounds of the past?â€”Nick Riganas

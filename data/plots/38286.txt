Three friends leave Milan by car heading south. Two of them are married to two sisters and the third one is about to marry the third sister. The wedding will take place in their vulgar but very rich father-in-law's villa. They're also bringing him a work of modern art: a wooden leg worth millions even if it doesn't look like it. The journey is eventful: the groom-to-be falls in love with another woman; the leg is lost to a team of Moroccan footballer players and then returned; and the old man's dog gets lost. The father-in-law gets angrier and angrier, and when they finally reach the villa, he is waiting for them with a shotgun in his hands..â€”Salvatore Santangelo <pappagone2@libero.it>

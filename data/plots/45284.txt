The movie begins with Sekiuchi, chairman of the Sannokai, a huge organized crime syndicate controlling the entire Kanto region, issuing a stern warning to his lieutenant Kato and right-hand man Ikemoto, head of the Ikemoto family. Kato orders Ikemoto to bring the unassociated Murase family in line for their drug trafficking business, as he knows that Ikemoto is Murase's sworn brother. Ikemoto immediately passes the task on to his subordinate Otomo, who runs his own crew. Ikemoto is suspecting that Sekiuchi has lost confidence in him and instructs Otomo to "shake up" Murase as to make it look like that have "a little quarrel". What ensues is series of violent events in between which everybody is trying to trick everyone behind his back for their own benefit.â€”Rade Martinovic

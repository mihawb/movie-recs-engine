Swedish-Norwegian half-sisters Ida (Gammel) and Tuva (Martin) set out on a winter dive in a remote part of the Norwegian coastline. Towards the end of the dive a rockslide traps Tuva under water. During Ida's fight to save Tuva, a fractured sisterhood is exposed, and when all seem lost, the stakes have risen beyond simple survival.

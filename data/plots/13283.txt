In this movie Ro, an island girl who was shipwrecked when she was a child, is raised by an adorable red panda, a curious elephant and a beautiful peacock. When she is discovered by a handsome Prince he takes her back to his castle. His parent (the Queen and King) dislike her and think she is mad as she can talk to the animals at the royal palace.
The Prince tho, is in love with Ro but his parents want him to marry Princess Luciana whose mother, Queen Ariana, is determined to get her revenge on the Prince's family.
Ro (or Rosella as its known to be) finds out that her family may be alive after all and the Princesses mother comes up with a plot to get rid of her. Making the animals sleep and cannot be woken is her evil plan in which Ro gets the blame.

Dr. Caroline Jessup does not believe in multiple personality disorder. Her father Dr. Harding challenges her beliefs by introducing her to a patient of his, whom seemingly disproves that. She first meets David Bernberg in a wheelchair and after a series of questions demands to know why her father has asked her to meet him. She is later introduced to Adam Saber, and Wesley Crite. All the people whom this patient claims to be have already died. She later finds that he is really a doomed faith healer Reverand Christian Moore who was punished by the mountain people for his hypocrisy. He must not harvest the souls of the faithless, and Caroline must attempt to stop him from collecting her daughter's soul.

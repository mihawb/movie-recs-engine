The coming together of Marina and Ricky is the meeting of two somewhat lost souls, albeit in not the healthiest of circumstances. Marina is a former porn actress and recovering junkie trying to go the straight and narrow in filming a mainstream movie under the direction of Máximo, a proverbial dirty old man whose attraction to her is only exacerbated by he having suffered a recent stroke which has rendered him permanently wheelchair-bound limiting ways he can deal with his raging libido. Marina has the emotional support of her family, especially her sister Lola who works as a production assistant on the film. Orphaned when he was three, Ricky has spent the better part of his life in a psychiatric facility in he somewhat feigning mental instability, not that he isn't truly without his psychiatric problems. He has learned a variety of trades while institutionalized, locksmithing his favorite as it has allowed him to escape from the facility time and time again, he however always returning in really having nowhere else to go in being all alone in the world, and as he has had an ongoing sexual relationship with the facility's female director. He made the decision to become "sane" to be released so that he could be with Marina with who he had a singular sexual encounter on one of his previous escapes. With Marina really not knowing who he is - she indeed doesn't remember him - he believes he has no other option but to kidnap her so that the two can spend time together long enough for her to fall in love with him, his goal for them to get married and start a family. In doing so, he does not want to hurt her but will do whatever required to subdue her if she puts up a fight. While certain issues, such as she suffering from a raging toothache, regular painkillers not doing much due to her junkie past, only add to the problems of her kidnap, let alone people like Máximo and Lola who would notice her missing and thus go looking for her, Marina may discover that there truly is a fine line between love and hate, especially as she may be as needy as him for real human connection.—Huggo

A venomous blood feud divides the powerful clans of the Montagues and the Capulets in the medieval city of Verona, unfolding William Shakespeare's eternal story of teenage love. And as youth's insolence arms charming young Romeo Montague with dauntless courage to come uninvited to the Capulets' scintillating masked ball, a brief but thrilling encounter with delicate dark-haired Juliet Capulet paves the way for ardent passions and cruel romantic tragedy. Once, the star-crossed lovers exchanged vows of everlasting devotion despite their perilous plight. But now, before the grim machinations of fate, man stands powerless. Are Romeo and Juliet destined to be together?â€”Nick Riganas

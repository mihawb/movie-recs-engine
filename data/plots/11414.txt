When the truck that is transporting convicts has an accident on the road, inmates John "Joker" Jackson and Noah Cullen, who are chained to each other, escape. They hate each other but they need to help each other to succeed in their intent of going north to jump into a train and reach freedom. Meanwhile the humane Sheriff Max Muller organizes a posse to track them down in a civilized manner and respecting justice. Joker and Cullen reach a small farm where a lonely woman helps them to get rid of their chains. She offers to drive her car with Joker and her son Billy while Cullen would escape through the swamp to the railroad. But when Joker learns that she sent Cullen to a trap, he leaves her and is shot in the shoulder by Billy. Joker seeks out Cullen to save him and when they meet each other, their former hatred has changed to friendship and respect.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

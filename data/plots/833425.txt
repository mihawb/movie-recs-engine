A heavy snow blizzard prevents her journey and she is forced to stay in a mountain visitor center, with four other strangers. When she goes for a short stroll trying to find a signal for her mobile phone, she finds a little kid locked inside a car. Despite being stuck because of the snow blizzard, she tries to find out who the kidnapper is.â€”Frank Liesenborgs <frank.liesenborgs@gmail.com>

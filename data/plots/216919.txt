DESEO is based on Arthur Schnitzler's 'Reigen' (Viena, 1897), arguably one of the major scandals on the European theatre scene of the 20th Century (recently reconfigured for London's West End by David Hare as 'The Blue Room' -staged by Sam Mendes and performed by Nicole Kidman and Iain Glen).A tragic expose of the decadence of the aristocracy (drawing striking similarities between 19th Vienese and contemporary Mexican societies), it is a fable, a burlesque of the cicle of venereal contagion through all rungs of society, with the cadence of a 'roundelay'; a humorous merry-go-round of illicit erotic encounters.Outrageously faithful to the play's piquant satirical tone, the film sketches the ardors of concupiscence, lust for power, seduction and disillusionment in all walks of life, as it challenges and mocks many sacrosanct notions about prudery and hypocrisy.While Schnitzler's hilarious play was said to depict the "merciless mechanism of sex" without actually showing it, the film does have a highly erotic allure, as it is beautifully wrought. However, in it's undercurrent, "DESEO" thouches upon more deleterious and tragical hungers.Zavala Kugler aptly intertwtines the distinct passages with artful dexterity. The mesmerizing selection of music underscores the dramatic structure while becoming at times part of the cast which, without exception, is undoubtedly "la crème de la crème" of Mexican performing arts.DESEO is a splendid consummation of Schnitzler's play, masterfully adapted to modern-day Latin America.

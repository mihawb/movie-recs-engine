As Khaled, a young Syrian mechanic who has escaped Aleppo's living nightmare, finds his way into Helsinki by accidentally stowing himself away on a coal freighter, on the other side of town, joyless traveling salesman Wikström experiences a profound mid-life crisis. Under those circumstances, Khaled and Wikström, who are desperately looking for a fresh start, eventually cross paths when the latter, after an endless night of high-stakes poker, buys himself a decrepit restaurant and offers Khaled not only shelter but also work. In the end, whether the Syrian refugee has a future in the Finnish capital is unknown, but what is undisputed is that he will find an eccentric but affectionate new family.—Nick Riganas

Suave, irresistible, and self-confident, the successful New York City cosmetics firm executive, Marcus Graham, lives a bachelor's dream life. Refusing to settle down and get married, Marcus will meet his match in the person of his new equally evasive and utterly ambitious boss, Jacqueline, who is in the habit of playing with men. Now--as, more and more, the self-assured advertiser gets a taste of his own medicine--Marcus needs to re-evaluate his life and the way he treats women if he wants to experience what he is truly after: an unrestrained passion and, above all, true love. However, is he capable of change?â€”Nick Riganas

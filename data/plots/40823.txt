André, relatively poor, falls in love with Silvia, a neighbor he spies on with a telescope. Falling more and more in love with her, he begins to follow her around the city and realizes she works in a clothing shop. He works in a Xerox place and makes a copy of a brand new $50-bill to buy a dress from her store. This becomes a vice and he begins to photocopy more and more money, until it gets out of control. Things go wrong when he decides that photocopying is not the only way to make money.—Anonymous

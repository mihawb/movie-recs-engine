Hungry for a large bowl of hot, scrumptious pork ramen, seasoned truck drivers Goro and Gun chance upon the Lai Lai: a ramshackle roadside noodle shop run by sweet widow Tampopo. Instead, a lukewarm first impression awaits the two truckers on a chilly night pouring with rain. As a result, the taciturn lone riders decide to lend a hand, assisted by a strong team of culinary ronin. And just like that, a challenging mission to teach the unsuccessful cook a thing or two about the tasty Japanese dish begins. But first things first. Does Tampopo have what it takes to discover the elusive winning recipe and beat her competitors at their own game? Is she destined to become a ramen sensei?â€”Nick Riganas

Reluctantly, Mort Rifkin, a disenchanted New York City film critic and perpetually uninspired novelist, finds himself attending the annual San Sebastián International Film Festival as the plus-one of his elegant, successful, press-officer wife Sue. as her plus-one. She has her hands full organizing the schedule of her lofty French auteur protégé Philippe, so neurotic Mort whiles away the time wandering around the picture-perfect resort town and trying to become friends with local cardiologist Dr Jo Rojas, convinced that they don't make movies like they used to. However, the heart wants what it wants, and as he re-envisions the work of the great European masters--such as François Truffaut, Ingmar Bergman, Jean-Luc Godard, Federico Fellini, and Luis Buñuel--Mort's black-and-white celluloid dreams come to life. Can life become exciting again at Rifkin's Festival?—Nick Riganas

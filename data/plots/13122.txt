A young boy helps his sister's boyfriend burgle the house of their money grabbing landlord on the boy's 13th birthday. The house is a cross between that of the Adams Family and Fort Knox.. The burglars manage to get in but they cannot get out. The owners return. Locked inside the house, unable to escape, the boy witnesses the horrific habits of the owners, and the numerous caged "people under the stairs".â€”Rob Hartill

Ji-Hoo is the new employee at a PR firm. He is admired for his good looks, competence and generosity by everyone in the office, including an aloof but beautiful woman named Ji-Woo, who secretly has a crush on him. The grouchy department manager, Mr. Hwang, even calls him "Mr. Perfect." Initial appearances can be deceiving, however, and through a somewhat improbable miscalculation, Ji-Hoo inadvertently exposes his true nature to JI-Woo. Out of shame, he admits to her that he is an emotional mess with serious self-esteem issues, whose fondest desire is to be ordered around and verbally humiliated by the woman of his dreams.Ji-Woo has secrets of her own. She admits to Ji-Hoo that she has a natural propensity to be direct and bossy with people, tendencies that she suppresses at work in order not to appear "cold and scary" to men. She is exactly the kindred spirit that Ji-Hoo has been seeking--a compassionate, but dominant, alpha female to complement his beta personality. He tells her so, proposing that she formally become his mistress in a female-led relationship, while assuring (lying to) her that he has no sexual interest in her (to her chagrin).Seohyun is superb as the open-minded ing√©nue, who readily accepts Ji-Hoo's proposal. Although confident and assertive by nature, kink is completely new to her. But smitten with Ji-Hoo, and surprisingly tolerant of his unorthodox "interests," she avidly goes along for the ride, hoping eventually to transform the relationship into a more traditional romance--if only she can fake it that long. She proves to be a quick study, however, and after a little research and practice, soon discovers the gratifying payoff of the exercise, finding their play sessions become increasingly "exciting," and playing the role of mistress with alacrity. But is it enough to substitute for a normal relationship?

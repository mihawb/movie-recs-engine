Dumped by his filthy rich octogenarian wife for a younger toy-boy after twenty-five years of prosperous marriage, the pampered and now penniless gold-digger, Maximo, finds himself with his back to the wall. Forced to take matters into his own hands, perhaps for the very first time in his once-luxurious life, the ageing gigolo will have no other choice but to swallow his pride and seek shelter in the small house of his estranged widowed sister, Sara, and his ten-year-old nephew, Hugo. However, Maximo is utterly unprepared for the rude awakening coupled with a big slice of real life on the side. But, once a seducer, always a seducer, and as spoiled Maximo struggles to squeeze out one decent idea to seduce yet another fabulously wealthy widow, a new window of opportunity appears; one that includes a profitable first-rate tutorship in how to be the perfect Casanova. Can a leopard change its spots?â€”Nick Riganas

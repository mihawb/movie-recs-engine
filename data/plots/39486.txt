The highly fictionalized adaptation of the Secretariat story from Penny Tweedy's supposed lack of horse racing knowledge to the much overblown rivalry between Secretariat and his "nemesis" Sham. With the help of eccentric trainer but supreme horseman Lucien Laurin, this is the story of a Virginia horse taking racing by storm and making himself a household name while winning the first Triple Crown in 25 years in World Record time.â€”R.

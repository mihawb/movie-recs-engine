A comedy about a man who clones himself to save his marriage, and then almost loses his wife-- to himself! Overworked and over-scheduled, contractor Doug Kinney never has enough time for his wife and family. So when a helpful geneticist offers to "xerox" Doug, it seems like the perfect solution-- until the clones begin to take over his home, his job, and his bed.â€”Robert Lynch <docrlynch@yahoo.com>

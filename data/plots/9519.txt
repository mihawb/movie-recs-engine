Macho Aussie Mark Brandon 'Chopper' Read doesn't even want to control his violent mood, dreaming of becoming an 'admired' crime legend. A confusing flash back structure from a murder trial shows his fickle paranoia, jealousy and arrogance can bring him no booty. He's even too insignificant for major charges. Nevertheless his abominable misbehavior, mainly at friends and loved ones' expense, ends up launching him into another career.â€”KGF Vissers

Baby Bink couldn't ask for more; he has adoring (if somewhat sickly-sweet) parents, he lives in a huge mansion, and is just about to appear in the social pages of the newspaper. Unfortunately, not everyone in the world is as nice as his parents; especially the three enterprising kidnappers who pretend to be photographers from the newspaper. Successfully kidnapping him, they have a harder time keeping hold of him, who not only keeps one step ahead of them, but seems to be more than a little bit smarter than them.â€”Murray Chapman <muzzle@cs.uq.oz.au>

Unbeknownst to them, it is a wishing fountain. The next day, they awake to find that they are in each others body. Now living each others life, they soon discover that the grass is not greener. They go back to find the fountain, only to find that it has been moved. Stuck in their situation, Mitch needs to go to Dave's law firm with some important documents.

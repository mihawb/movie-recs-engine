In Basra, Iraq, the American soldier Bart Gregory is ambushed and murdered by the locals. On the night after his funeral, he awakes in his grave and goes to the house of his best friend, the pothead Joey Luebner, who does not understand in what Bart has turned into. They unsuccessfully go to a hospital and at dawn, Bart faints and Joey calls his friend, the nurse Mathilda to help him. They realize that Bart is a revenant, a combination of zombie and vampire, since he needs to drink blood to hold and recover the decomposition of his body. They decide to kill thieves, drug dealers and rapists to get their blood, drugs, weapons and money and they are called Vigilante Gunslingers by the press. One night, Joey is deadly wounded by a criminal and Bart turns him into a revenant. But when Bart's girlfriend Janet convinces him to turn her into a revenant, the friendship of Joey and Bart is affected.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

Andy and his three nerdy mates are graduating A-students, but feel they missed out on juvenile fun and make a pact to catch up with love - and party life during the summer before each attending another ivy League college. 'The lion' is first to score via his dojo job as martial arts sensei. Andy's job as country club junior tennis coach however is perfect to earn a pretty penny from private lessons, often actually in wealthy bored women's beds, which gets him exposed to the senior staff after driving naked to avoid an early-returning husband catching on. Andy still dreams of true love with an Indian Internet BFF whom he promises to pay for a ticket so they can meet at last.â€”KGF Vissers

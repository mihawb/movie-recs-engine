After their exciting adventure in Tarzan (1999), Tarzan, the mighty lord of the apes, and beautiful Jane Porter, his elegant mate, celebrate their first year together. To find the perfect gift for Tarzan, Jane combs the jungle, even enlisting the help of Terk, the gorilla, and Tantor, the elephant. As their first wedding anniversary approaches, Jane recalls their many adventures and realises what an exciting year it's been in the jungle so far, outsmarting panthers or surfing the lava down an erupting volcano. Their old friends, and their new enemies, remind Tarzan and Jane that, even though they come from entirely different worlds, when together, they are an unbeatable, unrivalled team. However, has Jane made up her mind? Above all, what surprise has Tarzan in store for Jane?â€”Nick Riganas

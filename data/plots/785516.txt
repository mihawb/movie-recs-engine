The streets of Paris are silent and empty. While many flee the capital, seven families experience lockdown in a building on the rue de l'Humanité. A café owner who reuses her pear alcohol as a hydroalcoholic gel; a geeky Zoom sports coach who gets fatter by the week; his seven-months-pregnant singer fiancée who doesn't want to go to hospital alone; and a self-made man who desperately wants to be as smart as his 8-year-old son. Three months of lockdown, joy, fear, humor, and drama. Seven families in one building, who don't really know one another, meet one another, grow closer, are at one another's throats and reconcile again.—jakkepoes

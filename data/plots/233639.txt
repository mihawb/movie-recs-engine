Mika is in rage. Not only did she fail her final exams but she and her best friend Fanny managed to set her teachers car on fire! Accidentally of course, but that doesn't prevent her parents from canceling the previously planned summer camp. Instead Mika is cast off to the countryside, where her strict grandmother runs a stable and will supervise her granddaughter all summer. Even though Mika has never cared for horses in her life, she is not going to spend all summer looked up studying or working under the instructions of stable-boy Sam. Within the darkest corner of the stables Mika finds the wild and skittish stallion WINDSTORM. Neither Michelle, the most qualified Equestrian of the stables, nor Mikas grandmother have managed to tame the ferocious beast. Magically magnetized by the fearful animal Mika sneaks, despite all warnings, into the stallions stall. Igniting an unusual friendship, through which Mika discovers her true passion and talent: She can communicate with horses! But will she manage, against all odds, to tame Windstorm?

After three revolutions, five republics, and two long and painful years of incarceration in an overcrowded, violent African prison, the French secret service agent, Major Josselin Beaumont, returns home. But this time, after a botched attempt to assassinate Malagawi's brutal dictator, President N'Jala, by order of the French government, double-crossed Joss is bent on taking his sweet revenge on those who betrayed him and bring war on the doorstep of elegant Paris. They say revenge is a dish best served cold, and highly trained Joss knows how to wait. Is there an escape from fate and dangerous Josselin, the professional?â€”Nick Riganas

Raquel (Deborah Secco) was a young woman from the SÃ£o Paulo middle class, who was studying at a traditional school in the city. One day she made a surprising decision: she left home and decided to become a call girl. Codenamed Bruna Surfistinha, Raquel lived several "professional" experiences and gained national prominence when she recounted her sexual and effective adventures on a blog, which later turned into a book and became a best seller.

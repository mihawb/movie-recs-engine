A woman trying to cope up with her husband's suicide goes on a road trip all alone. She keeps seeing a man who she thinks is following her almost everywhere. When the man overtakes and zooms ahead and at the same time almost causes the woman to crash, the woman heaves a sigh of relief thinking he wasn't following her. Later at another destination, the same man approaches her to convey his apologies for overtaking thereby causing the woman to sense that something ain't right.â€”Fella_shibby@yahoo.com

Jack Frost is a singer who's on the road most of the time so he can't spend a lot of time with his son, Charlie, although they love each other very much. When Jack is killed in a car accident, Charlie becomes a very sad boy, until...Jack returns as a snowman. Now they can do all the things they've missed when he was human, but what will people think when they see Charlie talking to a snowman and what will happen when the weather gets warmer?â€”Peter Huiskes <huiskes@westbrabant.net>

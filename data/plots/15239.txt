In Tromaville, Melvin works in a health club with his bucket and mop as a janitor. The sadistic and bullies Bozo and Slug and their girlfriends Julie and Wanda, who love to hit-and-run people in empty streets, play a cruel prank in Melvin and he falls off the window in a barrel of toxic wastes in a truck parked in front of the health club. He turns into the strong monster Toxic Avenger and protects the town from criminals. He saves the blind Sara from a rape and soon they become sweethearts. At the same time that he is worshiped by the residents, the corrupt Mayor Peter Belgoody and his gang want to destroy him.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

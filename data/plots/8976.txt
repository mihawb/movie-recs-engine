While flying from Los Angeles to New York, "good boy" Oliver Martin meets "bad girl" Emily Friehl and they have sex in the restroom. They stay together all day in New York, when Oliver discloses the planning of his life--his future career, successful job, then raising a family. He gives Emily his mother's phone number and asks her to call six years later to check. For seven years, they occasionally meet, and in the end, their relationship becomes love.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

It's 1955, and relations are tense between Nasser's Egypt and France, friendly with Farouk. Hubert Bonisseur de la Bath, a French spy, is in Cairo to investigate the disappearance of Jack Jefferson, a fellow OSS operative and Hubert's best friend. Hubert's cover is an urban chicken ranch; his assistant is the beautiful Larmina. One Arab asks about Hubert: is he smart, or is he an imbecile? He fights well but he's supremely smug and self-confident, even as he's deaf to cultural nuance and others' feelings, so the odds are even that he might survive.â€”<jhailey@hotmail.com>

The efficient, productive Lulu Massa is an exemplary, beloved worker for his employers and hated by his coworkers. During a turbulent period in the factory between the union and the radical students against the owners, Lulu accidentally loses one of his fingers. He changes his behavior and joins the movement of the students that wants to stop the factory with a strike as part of the class struggle, while the union wants a partial strike to reclaim benefits to the working class. When Lulu is fired, he gets confused with the new situation. But the union includes his readmission as a subject to be discussed with the owners and he is rehired.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

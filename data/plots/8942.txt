Dreaming of the cold Alaskan landscapes and a better future, young Wendy Carroll and her dog, Lucy, become stranded in a small Oregon town, when her old, rusty, and decrepit car breaks down. Hungry, without friends, and almost penniless, Wendy will have to resort to desperate measures, only to come face to face with her worst fear. Suddenly, Ketchikan and the unfulfilled promise of a profitable employment in a fish cannery start to fade away. Can the two companions finish their long journey to freedom?â€”Nick Riganas

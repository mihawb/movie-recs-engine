The movie tells the story of two friends: the taciturn Tommaso who lives in Canada, and the exuberant Giuliano who lives in Rome. When Giuliano, who is seriously ill, makes an irreversible decision, Tommaso overcomes his fear of flying and visits him in Rome to spend their last four days of friendship together. The two are not alone: the third star is Giuliano's dog, Pato.

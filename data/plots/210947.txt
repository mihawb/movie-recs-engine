The Canadians Derek Lee, who has an aneurysm and may die in any moment, and Clifton "Clif" Prowse are best friends and decide to quit their jobs to travel around the world. They arrive first in Barcelona, where they meet two other friends that are musicians and they together to Paris, where they have scheduled a concert. The shy Derek meets Audrey and they spend the night together. In the morning, his friends come to his room and find Derek bitten and covered in blood but they do not go to the hospital since Derek is afraid of interrupting his trip. When Clif and Derek arrives in Italy, Derek vomits the food; burns with the sunlight; and his strength has increased a lot. Soon they discover that Derek was infected by Audrey and now he is a vampire. Clif tries to help his friend, but how?â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

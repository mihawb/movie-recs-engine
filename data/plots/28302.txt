Now the royal couple Odette and Derek face yet another evil magician, this time a woman named Zelda. She was once a consort to Rothbart, plans to wreak havoc to their kingdom by stealing the Forbidden Arts. As part of her plan, she captures a Yakey-bird named Whizzer who has the ability to imitate any voice after hearing it only once. Threatening his life, she sends Whizzer to the castle at Swan Lake as a spy. There, Whizzer overhears that Derek did not destroy Rothbart's notes on the Forbidden Arts. The Prince then must face Zelda in an exciting showdown to rescue Odette and Jean-Bob.â€”Anthony Pereyra {hypersonic91@yahoo.com}

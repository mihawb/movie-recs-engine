Eat Drink Man Woman is a classic tale of simmering frustrations and relationship woes as semi-retired Master Chef Chu shares his culinary skills and tends to his three unmarried daughters' respective emotional journeys. Jia-Jen is a chemistry teacher, Jia-Chien an airline executive and Jia-Ning works at a fast-food establishment. Together they help prepare and eat a sumptuously elaborate dinner each Sunday, a family tradition which allows for considerable insight into their lives and fuels the fire for each daughter to deal with the turmoil of new romantic challenges.

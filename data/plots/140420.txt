Pretty soon, they force him to change direction, as the lip-sticked paper flies off!It soon catches the attention of the young woman, and begins to lead her onto a train.When she gets off, she finds the young man, covered in airplanes, has arrived at the same station, and they share a moment.The final images show the two in a coffeeshop, talking about their strange day.As she leaves the office across the way

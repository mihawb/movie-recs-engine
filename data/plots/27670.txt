The theme of Non ci Resta che Piangere is not that these two characters wander aimlessly through the Italian renaissance encountering people haphazardly. The point is that in modern times the sister of one of them is about to marry an American soldier based in Italy and they believe that if they go back in time and they can convince their Italian ancestor, Christopher Columbus, NOT to discover America they will prevent the entire sequence of events that will inevitably lead the the establishment of the country of America from which that soldier would come to marry and take away his sister.

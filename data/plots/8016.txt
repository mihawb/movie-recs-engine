In 1947, an ordinary German family fights to survive in a wrecked Berlin after the end of World War II. The father is very sick, unable to work and bring food home; his older son Karl-Heinz is a former soldier hiding from the police, afraid of the consequences of fighting in the war; his daughter Eva is waiting for her boyfriend Wolf and goes to clubs at night to bring valuable cigarettes and minor gifts to contribute to her family's survival; and 12-year-old Edmund wanders through the devastated city trying to find work or food. When he meets his former teacher, Herr Henning, he will be led to a desperate final solution.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

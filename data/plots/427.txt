The hopeless Monsieur Hulot once again finds himself affecting people's lives without realizing what he has done. Hulot has taken his young nephew under his wing allowing him to play with other children. The boy's parents live in a ultra-modern house where the boy's overly pretentious mother will barely let him breathe. Concerned that he may be a bad influence on the boy, Hulot's sister and brother-in-law devise a plan to keep him occupied. Their attempt to introduce him to other people at their garden party doesn't work out as planned - with hilarious results for everyone concerned.â€”garykmcd

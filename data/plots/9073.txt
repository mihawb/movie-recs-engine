Two years ago, 14-year-old teenager Jesse helped the whale Willy to jump into freedom. Jesse enjoys the life with his adoptive parents, when his half-brother Elvis arrives because of the death of their mother. During a camping trip Jesse meets Willy again, as well as his Indian friend Randolph. A tender love develops between Jesse and Rudolph's goddaughter Nadine. Suddenly a crashed oil tanker endangers the whales, and several animal and human lives have to be saved as well when the oil catches fire.â€”Tom Pfeifer <pfeifer@fokus.gmd.de>

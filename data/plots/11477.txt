While trying to escape her bad luck and the marital problems with her recently fired husband, real estate agent Julia, much to her surprise, finds the opportunity of a lifetime when commissioned to sell a fully furnished luxurious apartment, a proper gem lying hidden in a somewhat dilapidated tenement building downtown. Then, unexpectedly, Julia will accidentally discover the reclusive previous owner's stash of 300 million pesetas, an astonishing finding that will fill her heart with greed and dreams of a luxurious life, unaware though, that everyone in the building knows about the dead man's fortune, patiently waiting for the old geezer to kick the bucket and share the loot. Soon, as Julia decides to keep it all for herself ruining the petty and conniving tenants' plans, she will find herself under siege in a slow-simmering battle of poor moral between the greedy antagonists that will inevitably lead to a dramatic finale atop Madrid's tiled rooftops.â€”Nick Riganas

Raised in the UK, pensive, polite, introverted English writer Basil travels to the Island of Crete, Greece, to reopen the abandoned mine he inherited from his father. Not knowing what to expect, Basil strikes up an acquaintance with Zorba, an exuberant Greek peasant, and just like that, an unexpected friendship begins to form. Nurturing an insatiable love for life, Zorba takes shy Basil under his wing, teaching him how to embrace his Greek heritage, deal with life's ups and downs, and discover the liberating feeling of the slow and fast rhythms of the famous Sirtaki dance.â€”Nick Riganas

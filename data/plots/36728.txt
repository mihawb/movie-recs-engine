Ninjas with special bloodline abilities (kekkie Genkie) begin dissapearing from various nations. The mastermind behind these dissapearances originally belonged to the leaf village and thus the village is accused of treachery. The sorrounding nations begin preparing for war. With the world's anger on the leaf village, can Naruto and Kakashi prevent the fourth great ninja war and preserve their will of fire?â€”Michael Ballard

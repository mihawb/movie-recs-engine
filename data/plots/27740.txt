Reluctantly, the amoral anthropologist, Joe Weber, leaves the vast and dangerous Peruvian jungles, to return to the United States and take care of his rebellious teenage son, Jeremy. As the estranged father and son embark on a bonding trip to Joe's hometown of Salem's Lot, Maine, to visit Aunt Clara's decrepit house, right from the start, strange occurrences are a dead giveaway that something evil has gotten hold of the town. Now, fresh, bright-red blood stains the seemingly peaceful community, and there's no telling what Joe and, especially, Jeremy, have gotten themselves into. Indeed, a return to Salem's Lot was a poor decision. Is there an escape from the town of terror?â€”Nick Riganas

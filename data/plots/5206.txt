The Danish lawyer Ravn owns a technology company, called 'IT', that he founded with the money he borrowed from his six directors. However, he invented a fictitious and powerful president named "The Boss of It All" to cover the unpopular policies of the company with the employees. When he decides to sell up the company to the Icelandic entrepreneur Finnur, the buyer demands to negotiate directly with the president of IT. Ravn hires the unemployed actor Kristoffer, who is a fan of the actor Antonio Gambini, to perform the role of president of IT under a contract of confidentiality. As time progresses, Kristoffer gets close to, and emotionally involved with, the employees of IT. He finds out information about the employees.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

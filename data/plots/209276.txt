Juvenile repeat offender Eric Love (19) earns by incorrigible insolence and violent rebellion a 'promotion' from reformatory to adult prison, where his reckless provocative attitude towards staff and fellow inmates bodes grave trouble for all. Eric's ever)absent father Neville is a veteran there, a trusted deputy of informal prison leader Dennis Spencer, who agrees to help trying to get Eric on the road to rehabilitation. Despite Eric's gross abuse of (also hard-handed) jailers, earning deputy governor Hayes's grim hatred, they get him admitted to voluntary therapist Oliver Baumer's group, where 'kid' Eric stirs trouble, misbehaves, needs to be dragged back by Neville who lacks paternal authority or parental tenderness, yet finds support, camaraderie and some sense. But the rowdy already made too many enemies, out for vengeance on the Loves, undermining Dennis's position as guardian of a delicate order among prison scum.â€”KGF Vissers

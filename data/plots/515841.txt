I Am Not an Easy Man follows Damien and Alexandra while they run around the streets. While Damien is running around, he bonks his head. Obviously, his head now hurts really bad. So what's the remedy for a bonked head? Damien decides that women. So Damien walks up and the world is completely WRONG! Gender roles are completely reversed. What a wacky twist! Harvey. The two of them decide to go to Halloween. They love Halloween. Are men? Some people like men, and they are men. That's okay. But not in Alexandra eyes.Alexandra is very upset (She's 12). She doesn't like gay people. She decides that Damien is gay, and he must be put down. She is a vet. She follows Damien one day out to his car. Are? His car is a 2005 Toyota Corrolla, and it's a very silly car. So women. Am I right? I'm wrong? How dare you.When Alexandra reaches Damien, who is in his car listening to Weezer, she looks into his eyes. They were emerald brown, and sparkling. He looked at her. His lips slightly parted, and his eyes glossed with innocence. She felt something stir inside her. That look. It stared deep into her soul. He licked his lips, not breaking eye contact. She felt her heart rate quicken. She wanted him. Her tongue flew out of her mouth and she started panting like a dog. Damien blushed. He liked dogs. Dogs were his favorite. He pulled out a tennis ball and threw it. Alexandra started chasing it but it fell off of a cliff. Alexander, who is now a dog, fell off the cliff as well, for unrelated reasons. She died. Extremely gruesomely. I think. I might be remembering this movie wrong, but I think that's the end.

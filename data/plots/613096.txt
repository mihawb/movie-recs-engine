In 2019 Barcelona, Catalonia (in northeastern Spain), 35-year-old Marcos breaks the fourth wall like Ferris Bueller in Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986) to talk about himself as his life turns upside-down in the worst way: his 8-year relationship with Ana ends abruptly when she breaks up with him the same moment he proposes marriage; the next day, his boss fires him, claiming "personnel reduction." Defeated and without resources or money, Marcos is forced to move back in with his parents, obsessed to recover Ana at any cost. Feeling like an alien lost on planet Earth and totally unfamiliar with the 21th century's language and social networks, Marcos starts to follow the advice of Sebastián Vennet, a famous Argentinian Internet coach and guru, trying to change himself into a successful man and a sex machine. Blackmailing his close friend, unstoppable womanizer Diego, Marcos gets a job as sports commentator in the Internet section of the newspaper where Diego works. Later he meets Raquel, a former high-school classmate who returned to Barcelona after several years in London. Funny, outlandish, loudmouthed, streetwise, free-spirited accordion player and amateur singer Raquel is a force of nature who decides to help Marcos change his life. Then the unexpected happens: Ana reappears, wanting him only for sex, leaving him confused. He keeps his encounters with Ana secret from Raquel, as his beautiful, vain, sex-bomb work colleague Lorena hits on him, after having turned him down several times in the past. Marcos realizes his true feelings about Raquel at the worst moment: a casual meeting in a disco among the three causes Raquel to discover the truth, catching Marcos in the most inconvenient moment. Feeling more lost than before, Marcos is forced to decide what he really wants in life before he loses everything.—Chockys

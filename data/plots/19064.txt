Everyone is getting laid except for Mark [Jim Carrey]. His girlfriend Robin [Karen Kopins] wants to wait so it can be something "beautiful". Mark doesn't want to wait, so he goes off in search of a lay. He meets the Countess [Lauren Hutton] who is looking for a virgin--a virgin's blood, that is. She invites Mark home with her and sucks him once. She follows him to a clothing store and takes her second drink. But drink three doesn't come as easily. Mark's girlfriend is getting wise. When Halloween comes, Mark wins the 'best costume' award for his vampire dress ("But I'm not wearing a costume!"), and the countess comes looking for her final drink. She almost wins except that Mark and his girlfriend sneak a quickie in a coffin. Mark no more virgin.

The Trial of the Juntas, 22 April 1985. In the nascent days of the Argentine Republic's newly formed government after the restoration of democracy in 1983, newly appointed federal chief prosecutor Julio César Strassera and his assistant, deputy prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo, led the investigation and the trial against the brutal military dictatorship that plunged Argentina into chaos for almost ten years. And entrusted with the Herculean task of putting the country's most powerful and dangerous men behind bars, the young lawyers and their inexperienced legal team played with fire while seeking justice for the crimes committed during the Dirty War of 1976-1983.—Nick Riganas

While vacationing in Spain, Mitch Rapp (played by Dylan O'Brien) proposes to his girlfriend. She accepts but a few minutes later dies when a jihadist cell lands and guns down the tourists. The purpose was to make Americans see how it feels to have your loved ones killed. The attack has the opposite effect: Mitch survives and lives to hunt down and kill those responsible.Mitch physically trains to be ready for the confrontation. Unknown to him, the watchful American government is impressed with his training. CIA agent Irene Kennedy (Sanaa Lathan) recruits him for a 'black ops' team and sends him to Dan Hurley (Michael Keaton), a former Navy Seal, for further training.World events move faster than expected, so Dan takes Mitch to Istanbul. In Turkey they meet with CIA agent Annika (Shiva Negar). Mitch and Annika pretend to be newlyweds in order to cover their real mission: prevent the jihadist construction of a nuclear bomb. Things don't go according to plan so Mitch improvises. Though he disobeys direct orders, his improvisation gets results.Further complicating this, Ghost (Taylor Kitsch), now a mercenary but formerly a member of Dan's group, works for the bad guys. In another plot twist, Annika works for the Iranian government. Too many things go wrong and the operation becomes a joint CIA and Mossad (Israel intelligence) collaboration. A final chase ends with the bomb headed for the U.S. navy fleet.Mitch throws the bomb overboard to let it detonate deep in the ocean. In the aftermath, an Iranian military man (secretly tied to the creation of the bomb) publicly blames the problems of his country on the U. S., which he promises to eliminate. He then gets into an elevator. Standing behind him is Mitch - the American Assassin.

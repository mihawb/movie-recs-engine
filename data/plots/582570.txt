When expectant father Alan, who grew up believing he was an only child, searches for his birthmother, he comes face-to-face with Russell, a brother he never knew existed and who now helps him uncover their true status as sextuplets (all played by Marlon Wayans). They go on a road trip to track down the other four siblings, but not before Alan wonders if exploring his roots was a huge mistake.â€”Netflix

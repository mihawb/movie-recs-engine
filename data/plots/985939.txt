Drowning in a sea of grief 51 painful weeks after the life-altering incident that scarred her for life, emotionally fragile rock climber Becky reluctantly decides to confront her fears, and as her thrill-seeking friend Hunter re-enters Becky's ruined life, the two experienced climbers embark on a high-risk climbing adventure to the top of the abandoned 2,000-foot B67 TV tower: an anxiety-inducing, vertigo-inspiring construction of weather-beaten metal and rattling rivets in the middle of the Mojave desert. However, when the peril-laden climb doesn't go as planned, the women must summon up every last ounce of courage and strength to devise a plan for a safe return home--or die trying.â€”Nick Riganas

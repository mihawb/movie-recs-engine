In Hollywood, spoiled director of humdrum movies John Lloyd Sullivan was born with a silver spoon but is very successful with his superficial comedies. Out of the blue, he tells his producer that he wants to make serious dramas, like "O Brother, Where Art Thou?" and he will live like a tramp on the streets to learn the sorrows of great part of the population. He wears cheap clothes and tries to blend with poor people but he always returns to Hollywood protected by the safety team hired by the studio. One day, he goes to a diner with a coin and a blonde girl offers him bacon and eggs. Soon he learns that the girl is a failed actress who never a chance in Hollywood and is hitchhiking home with no money. Sullivan rewards her kindness by giving her a ride in his car but they're arrested. When they're released, the girl joins Sullivan in his quest to learn about poverty. When Sullivan is satisfied, he is robbed and dumped unconscious in a train and awakens in the countryside where there's an incident and he is arrested and sentenced to a labor camp, where he leans the importance of comedy in the miserable lives of destitute people.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

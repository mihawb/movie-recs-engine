In New Jersey, Jeffrey is a talented inventor in love with his bride-to-be Elizabeth. During a barbecue to celebrate the birthday of Elizabeth's father, she activates a remote controlled lawnmower that Jeffrey built for his father-in-law. However she stays in front of the device and her body is cut into pieces. Jeffrey studies how to bring Elizabeth back to life and realizes that he will need body parts. He drives to New York to get the necessary parts from prostitutes but his experiment loses control and he blows-up several women with an exploding crack he had developed. Now he has the necessary parts to build his fiancée back, but when Elizabeth flees from his laboratory, Jeffrey has problems with the pimp Zorro that lost his girls.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

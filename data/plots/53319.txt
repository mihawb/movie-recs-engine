Checco, living in Milan, Lombardy, Northern Italy, but coming from Alberobello, in the Southern Region of Apulia, tries to follow his uncle's footsteps and join the Arma dei Carabinieri, the Italian gendermerie. Despite multiple attempts, he is refused due to telling stories about how his uncle used his authority for personal reasons. A priest helps him get a job as security guard in the Milan Cathedral (the Duomo). Unfortunately, the same Colonel who refused him is in charge of Duomo security, much to his anger. After many mistakes, Checco is placed to guard the "Madonnina," the highest statue on top of the Cathedral. Muslim siblings Sufien and Farah, seeking vengeance against the West, try to have him accidentally bring a bomb under the statue; Sufien sends Farah to seduce the simple, uneducated Southern Italian.â€”Aledownload

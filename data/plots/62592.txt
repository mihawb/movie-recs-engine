In New York City, published novelist Abigail Scanlon, who believes a second success won't happen soon with her raging case of writer's block, and actress Parker Wald, who goes on many auditions and wins few parts, no thanks to self-doubt and self-sabotage, have been friends since second grade in Lambert, Louisiana. Returning to their Southern hometown for Parker's parents' 30th anniversary, they run into the third and fourth in their group of four closest childhood friends. From what they have learned through keeping in touch, Rachel Phipps, the shy one who never left Lambert, has found the man of her dreams in Tony Penning. The fourth, Caitlyn McNabb, they had not kept in touch with since realizing that she is a b****. As children, Abigail and Parker were blinded by Caitlyn's family's wealth and being able to play at the McNabbs' family estate, Bellefontaine. Caitlyn was molded into what she is by her controlling mother Olivia, to whom money and prestige are everything; three times married, Olivia taught Caitlyn to believe that it isn't WHO one marries, but how capable he is in providing that life of wealth, luxury, and comfort. At one of Caitlyn's pre-wedding gatherings, Parker and Abigail reunite with Rachel, meet Caitlyn's other bridesmaids--three of her sorority sisters--and learn that the groom is Tony. When they learn directly that Rachel is heartbroken and still loves Tony, and learn through the grapevine that Caitlyn is probably marrying Tony for his family's money so that Olivia, now broke, can keep Bellefontaine while Caitlyn has her dream wedding, Abigail and Parker take it upon themselves to break up the wedding from the inside in maneuvering themselves into the roles of two replacement bridesmaids so that Rachel and Tony can have their meant-to-be happily ever after. Moving from plan to plan as further information comes to light, such as why Rachel did not put up more of a fight for Tony who still loves her as well, Abigail and Parker must decide how far they will go to achieve their mission, especially as Parker starts to fall for Lambert Police Lieutenant Henry Kent, who might not be able to overlook anything of a criminal nature. Will Olivia's maneuverings be the most difficult hurdles they need to overcome?â€”Huggo

Over two years after the events of the first film, Brad Brown (Scott Grimes) is now 15, and returns to Grovers Bend to spend Easter Weekend with his Grandma. Leftover Krite eggs that were in Brad's old farm are taken and mistaken for Easter eggs, unleashing the Krites onto the entire town. Luckily, Ug, Lee and the former drunk Charlie (Don Keith Opper), return from space to help Brad, the now retired Sheriff Harv (Barry Corben), Brad's crush Megan (Lianne Curtis) and the rest of the town fight the Krites once again.â€”nikeno71

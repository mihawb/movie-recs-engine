In the 1970's, a middle-class Cambodian girl sees her family's lives turning upside-down when the Khmer Rouge invades Cambodia. They leave their comfortable apartment and lifestyle to live in a primitive work camp. When her father, a former officer, is killed, the family splits to survive.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

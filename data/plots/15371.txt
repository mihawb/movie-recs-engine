After pulling off a heist at a Monaco Casino, Lupin and Jigen soon discovered that they just stole counterfeit money, which gives Lupin an idea on what their next job should be. So they set off for Cagliostro, a small European nation that's known for the Goat Bill Conterfeiting. When they entered the country, they saw a Bride in a car being chased by another car with a group of thugs. Lupin & Jigen tailed them, and got rid of the thugs, Lupin prevents the Bride from falling from a cliff, but he fell and broke the Bride's fall. The Bride left but was captured by another group of thugs. Jigen checked if Lupin was alright, Lupin got up, only to discover that the Bride left him a ring. Which he remember seeing sometime in the past. Who was that Bride?, where is the source of the Goat Bills?, and what connection does the ring have?â€”J LeGault

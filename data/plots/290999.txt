In the aftermath of a strange meteor shower in the vast Australian outback, Barry, a doting father and car mechanic, finds himself forced to flee his home after an unwelcome late-night encounter. Now, with his sister Brooke at the mercy of a paramilitary group and its mad scientist leader, Barry and a handful of armed-to-the-teeth survivors must fight tooth and nail to stay alive and save the girl from certain death. But the question remains: can the brave defenders survive the all-out attack of the undead army that has encircled them?â€”Nick Riganas

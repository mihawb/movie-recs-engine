For the past 100 years, mankind has been living peacefully behind giant walls that protect them from the Titans. One day, a super huge Titan breaches the wall, lets inside a horde of Titans who killed everyone including Eren's girlfriend, and forces Eren to retreat to the inner walls. Feeling vengeful, Eren joins the scouting legion in order to wipe all Titans from the world.â€”Immanuel A

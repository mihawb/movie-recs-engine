One of Northern Ireland's top IRA terrorists, Frankie McGuire, escapes to NY, where he, under the name of Rory Devaney, with support of friendly judge Peter Fitzsimmons, lives in the house of Irish cop Tom O'Meara, who doesn't know who Frankie really is. Rory tries to buy some weapons from dealer Billy Burke, while Tom has moral problems covering up the murder of a suspect by his partner cop Edwin Diaz. The problems arise when Tom begins to suspect something about Rory's identity.â€”Gustaf Molin <gumo@hem2.passagen.se>

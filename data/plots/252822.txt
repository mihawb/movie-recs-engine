In the snow-capped Norwegian town of Tyos, Nils Dickman, the hard-working family man and quiet snow-plough operator, has just been named Citizen of the Year for keeping the roads open. Then, his son, Ingvar, ends up dead by the local gang of drug dealers, for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. As a result--refusing to believe the police report--Nils embarks on a blood-drenched journey of revenge, working his way up in search of the man behind the murder of his only son. Now, as the dead bodies keep piling up, Dickman and his powerful sawed-off hunting rifle will stop at nothing until they find the elusive drug lord known as "The Count". Who can stand in the way of a wronged father turned icy avenger?â€”Nick Riganas

After her parents die from cholera, Mary is sent to live in Misselthwaite Manor in Yorkshire with her uncle Archibald Craven and the housekeeper Mrs. Medlock. Mary discovers that the house holds many secrets. There she finds a key that leads her to a garden held locked for years by her uncle after his wife's death. Soon she finds a room in the manor where her sick cousin Colin has spent his entire life in his bed, completely unable to walk. But Mary and her new friend Dickon manage to bring the garden back to life, and in the garden Colin learns to walk and becomes a healthy, happy boy. When Lord Craven sees the children playing in the garden one day, he is amazed by the sight of his son walking. He feels joy for the first time in years.â€”Annie_2330

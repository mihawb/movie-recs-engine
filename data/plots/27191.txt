To ensure that the Ringling Brothers and Barnum and Bailey Circus stays in the black, rugged, money-oriented manager Brad Braden brings in a famed aerialist known as The Great Sebastian to increase sales. However, as Brad's dogged determination moves ambitious trapeze artist Holly to the second ring, driving her into the arms of another man, the unbridled competition between the duelling star attractions invites heartbreak and disaster. And as profound, turbulent feelings emerge, cryptic clowns and villainous racketeers threaten Braden's future. Yet the circus is above all else. What will it take to keep the greatest show on Earth running?â€”Nick Riganas

Workaholic Salt Lake City architect Steven has a shot at promotion to senior partner if he pulls off two major projects. That leaves no time for a private life, yet the family that normally hosts him for Christmas now emotionally blackmails him to receive them in his near-empty home. So he hires the HQ-hired event decorator Gretchen, who attempt to set up her own party decoration form, initially to decorate his home, and when his parents, sister and her husband and teen daughter arrive to entertain them. He's still dragged along on some excursions, like choosing a Christmas tree, and starts questioning his career shift (friom homes to complexes) and obsession since his fiancee left for another, while sparks fly between him and Gretchen.â€”KGF Vissers

The Colombian cartel runs a mission through Mexico to deliver cocaine into the United States while holding two young hostages. Their plan is exposed when a former Navy SEAL helps the DEA and Border Patrol rescue the two girls. When the cartel leader hears word of their capture, he plans to kidnap the former Navy man's family in return for his help with their next shipment. This time in a submarine. It is up to Bruce Stryker to help the cartel deliver their inventory into the United States in order to get his family back.â€”Deepwater Productions

Benjamin (Tom Schilling) is invisible, a nobody. This changes abruptly when he meets charismatic Max (Elyas M'Barek). Although they couldn't seem more different from the outside, they share an interest: hacking. With Max's friends, impulsive Stephan (Wotan Wilke Mohring) and paranoid Paul (Antoine Monot), they form the subjective hacker collective CLAY (CLOWNS LAUGHING @ YOU). CLAY provokes with fun campaigns and speaks for a whole generation. For the first time in his life, Benjamin is part of something and even attractive Marie (Hannah Herzsprung) notices him. But fun turns into deadly danger when CLAY appears on the BKA's (Bundeskriminalamt, Federal Criminal Police Office) as well as Europol's most wanted list. Hunted by Cybercrime investigator Hanne Lindberg (Trine Dyrholm), Benjamin is no longer a nobody, but instead one of the world's most-wanted hackers.â€”Wiedemann & Berg Film

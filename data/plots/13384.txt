From a working class Yorkshire background, mid-teen Billy Casper is expected not to have much of a future, a prospect even prognosticated by his mother. This prospect is due to a life of neglect, with his father long having abandoned the family. Although he purports to have placed his criminal behavior behind him, Billy still commits the occasional petty crime when it suits his needs. Especially when he deals with anyone of authority, his mind usually wanders, which may be problematic again for his future in speaking to the employment officer about his post-schooling work life. He is bullied by a number of people from his older coal miner brother Jud, to some of his classmates, and even his teachers, especially his physical education teacher, Mr. Sugden. Billy's life has the potential to change when he finds something on which to focus. Having spotted a nest in a neighboring farmer's field, he plans to train a kestrel, a breed of falcon, knowing nothing about the process at the start.â€”Huggo

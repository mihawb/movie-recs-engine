Preston Waters is a 12-year-old boy who is sick of his parents always teaching him the value of money. Little does he know he is about to learn it. When a smart crook named Carl Quigley nearly kills Preston by running over his bike, he mistakenly fills out a blank check, which Preston prints out for $1 million. He convinces the bank manager to cash it and when Quigley's employee returns to collect the money for him and finds that the bank manager has given it to a kid. He sets out to track him down and get his money back. Preston creates the pseudonym of " Mr. Macintosh" to handle his finances and the police get suspicious. He begins his spending, but later becomes aware that he must avoid Quigley who is on his back and the police separately attempt to work out the mystery behind "Mr. Macintosh". Will Preston be convinced that money isn't everything?â€”Mekaeal Chaudary (Mekaeal_12345@hotmail.com)

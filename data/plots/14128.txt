The movie explores Cinderella's "happily ever after" life as a princess in three stories, with help from her Fairy Godmother. First, Cinderella's awkward first days at the palace, during which she tries so hard to fit in that she forgets to be herself. Second, how Jaq feels so left out that he wished to be a human. Third, how Cinderella teaches one of her nasty stepsisters how to smile, which leads to her own true love.â€”Britney

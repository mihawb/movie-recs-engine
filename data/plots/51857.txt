In the twilight of Francisco Franco's dictatorship, 8-year-old orphan Ana is convinced that she is responsible for the death of her father, an uninvolved, disloyal military officer. After their mother's untimely death, Ana and her sisters Irene and Maite go to live with their grandmother and Aunt Paulina and try their best to acclimatize to the new reality against the backdrop of a caged childhood. Through a series of dream-like sequences, Ana seeks solace by mixing memories with fantasy in her dimly-lit room, as, more and more, she develops a morbid relationship with what seems to be a ghost. This is Ana's desperate attempt to overcome life's constant impediments. Can she summon up the courage to grow up?â€”Nick Riganas

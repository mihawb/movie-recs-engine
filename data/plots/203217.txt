In Niterói, middle-class homemaker Dona Hermínia lives with her teenage son Juliano, who is gay, and her teenage daughter Marcelina, who is obese. Her husband Carlos Alberto has left her to live with a younger woman, the bimbo Soraia. When Carlos Alberto and Soraia go to the club with Juliano and Marcelina in his sports car, Dona Hermínia overhears the "children" making fun of her and she decides to take a time-out in the home of her aunt Zélia to calm down. Along the days, Dona Hermínia misses Juliano and Marcelina and tells stories of her life to Zélia. Meanwhile, the siblings feel how much they need her at home.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

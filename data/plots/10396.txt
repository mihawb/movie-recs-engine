Looking for a way out while desperately trying to go straight, the once-biggest coke dealer in California and now a small businessman, Dale "Mac" McKussic, finds himself in the law's crosshairs when he reluctantly agrees to make one last score. But before long, anxious to settle an old "accounting problem" with the mysterious Mexican drug kingpin known as Carlos, Dale drags the elegant restaurateur, Jo-Ann Vallenari, and his high school friend, Detective Lieutenant Nick Frescia, in a dangerous cat-and-mouse game. Now, with the DEA Agent, Hal Maguire, bent on bringing Dale to justice, long-simmering tensions rise, as loyalty, trust, and above all, friendship are put to the test. Can Mac overcome the desire to take the easy way out?â€”Nick Riganas

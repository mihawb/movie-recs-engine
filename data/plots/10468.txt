28 days was one of those movies you can tell the writer (Susannah Grant) knows the subject material, maybe even up close and personal. Director (Betty Thomas) did a wonderful job of giving Gwen's (Sandra Bullock) flashbacks that fuzzy look and sound where she isn't sure if they dreamed what happened or if it really did happen.

Carlo and Giulia have three children. He is a distracted "workaholic" father; she is a mother who has dedicated herself to the family by giving up her career. The children are Camilla, a 13-year-old rebellious teenager in full hormonal and sentimental development; 10-year-old Tito, smart and always playing "harmless" pranks; and 2-year-old Bianca, who does not speak, but uses gestures. Giulia, tired of the routine, tells the family that she is about to leave for 10 days of vacation. Carlo suddenly finds himself trapped in a real nightmare: between dinners to prepare, kindergarten placements, Camilla's embarrassing confided secrets, wild games with his son's friends, quarrels, near-disasters, and missed appointments at work, Carlo survives these 10 long days thanks to the help of Lucia, a very particular "Mary Poppins". Will this time help him get to know his children better and bring the family closer?â€”exe_malaga93

In occupied Paris, Jewish barber Roman Joffo can't keep up life with Nazi clients, ultimately deciding his family must flee. He, wife Anna and elder sons Henri and Albert go straight to Nice. Kid sons Maurice and Joseph 'Jo', the youngest, are sent separately through Vicy France by train, but the adventure goes pear-shaped, so they enroll in a Catholic school, until the Nazi Jew hunters start checking false identities. They escape to Nice, join their family for a while, remain after another raid chases the elder kin, taking jobs and Maurice even contacts the resistance. Jo misses the first bus back to liberated Paris to save the daughter of the avid collaborator who employed him, then rejoins his bothers, only father was killed in a concentration camp.â€”KGF Vissers

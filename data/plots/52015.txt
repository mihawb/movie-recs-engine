In a near future, the North America is an anarchic country after a vampire apocalypse. The teenager Martin is preparing to travel with his parents when they are attacked by a vampire. Martin is rescued by the stranger Mister and after killing the vampire, they head to the north expecting to reach the New Eden, former Canada. Along their journey through the destroyed country, Mister trains Martin and they rescue and befriend other survivors and have to fight not only against the vampires, but also a dangerous brotherhood of fanatic religious members led by the insane Jebedia Loven.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

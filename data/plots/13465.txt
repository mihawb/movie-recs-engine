Disney brings animated versions of 2 literary works to the screen here. The first is 'The Adventures of Mr. Toad', based on the characters from Kenneth Grahame's 'The Wind in the Willows'. The second is based on Washinton Irving's masterpiece 'The Headless Horseman', in which schoolteacher Ichabod Crane, smitten with Katrina Van Tassel, attends a party hosted by her father. Town thug Brom Bones, who also has his eye on Katrina, tries to intimidate Ichabod with the chilling story of 'The Headless Horseman', a ghost of a soldier in the revolutionary war who lost his head in a fight. When Ichabod rides home through Sleepy Hollow late at night, he finds himself confronted by the Headless Horseman who wants Ichabod's head for himself! Will Ichabod escape the terrifying, sword-wielding ghost....or will the Headless Horseman claim Ichabod's head for himself?â€”Derek O'Cain

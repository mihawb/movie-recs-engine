After the Exalted Ruler gets all local lodge members to swear they will attend the Sons of the Desert's annual convention in Chicago, Stan and Ollie have to find a way to get their wives to let them go. Stan has surprisingly little trouble doing so but for Ollie, it's a formidable task. In the end he fakes an illness getting a doctor (actually a veterinarian) to order him to take a cruise to Hawaii. So off the boys go to Chicago - and the plan would have worked brilliantly were it not for the fact that the ship they were to sail on sinks and the wives happen to see them in a newsreel.â€”garykmcd

Featuring the best of the well-known sketches from the first and the second season of the incomparable British comedy-sketch show, Monty Python's Flying Circus (1969), this witty compilation film is Monty Python's attempt to break into the United States audience. Including hilarious classic skits such as the "Dirty Hungarian Phrasebook", "Defence Against Fresh Fruit", "The Dead Parrot", "The Lumberjack Song", "The Dirty Fork", and of course, "The Funniest Joke in the World", this wacky anthology is, indeed, the beginner's guide to the spectacular, surreal, and mad world of the Monty Python. Now, brace yourselves up for something completely different.â€”Nick Riganas

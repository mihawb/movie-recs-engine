The film begins as black and white. Inventor Aleksandr Sergeevich Timofeev (aka Shurik) creates a time machine. Another experiment to launch it, periodically leading to burnout of traffic jams in the entrance, ended in an explosion, burnout of traffic jams in the whole house and loss of consciousness by Shurik. With the beginning of Shurik's dream, the film becomes color.â€”Peter-Patrick76 (peter-patrick@mail.com)

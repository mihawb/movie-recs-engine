The fastest growing startup in the human relationship market has 3 divisions: The Machine/computer programs, pharmaceuticals (fall in love drug's a best seller) and synthetic companions. Zoe/Léa Seydoux works there and decides to have The Machine evaluate her. In secrecy, she compares herself with colleague Cole/Ewan McGregor on the computer and gets a 0% compatibility rate. A new, handsome, synthetic man being taught and tested hits on her but she's not interested in a bunch of zeros and ones. Zoe mentions the 0% to Cole and he finally tells her. She's synthetic, less than a year old with AI, artificial memories and feelings. After long talks they start dating.—Scott Filtenborg

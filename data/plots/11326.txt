Cpt. Walker's plane is shot down during World War II and he is presumed dead. Nora Walker meets Frank Hobbs while her son Tommy is attending "Bernie's Holiday Camp" and they quickly marry--but Captain Walker is on his way home. Tommy follows his silhouette and sees his murder through a mirror that captures his and his father's souls. Nora and Frank tell Tommy that he didn't see it or hear it, and he must never speak of it. This causes him to go blind, deaf, and mute. They try a few cures, such as a preacher who believes Marilyn Monroe can heal, and a woman called "The Acid Queen." They then give up and leave Tommy with relatives: first Cousin Kevin rapes him, then Uncle Ernie rapes him. They finally decide to leave him by the mirror, which he curiously stares into all day long. He sees himself beckoning to him, and he follows--straight to a junkyard where he finds the device that will transform his life: a pinball machine. He becomes the world's greatest player, which makes his family rich. They go to a doctor who tells them they need to find some kind of shock to bring Tommy back into their world. The shock comes in the breaking of the mirror, which frees his soul. He believes that he is the new Messiah, and a religious cult forms around him.â€”Haruka Sawaguchi (harsawa@gmail.com)

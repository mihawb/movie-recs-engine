Violet Jones (Lathan) doesn't realize it at first but she's dismayed by her superficial, "perfect" life. She has everything she thought she'd need - a successful career, friends and a boyfriend who is a handsome doctor (Whittle). When her fairy tale begins to unravel, so does she. This movie shows what a beautiful, smart, successful woman can do when she starts to look inward instead of outward!â€”Kim Poulton

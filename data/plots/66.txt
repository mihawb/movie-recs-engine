The ageing ex-con and master thief, Luther Whitney, decides to pull off one last heist before retiring. After breaking into a seemingly impregnable mansion, much to his surprise, becomes the witness of a hideous act of violence, as the young woman, Christy Sullivan, ends up dead. Now, after a narrow escape, Luther is shocked to discover that the U.S. President, Alan Richmond, is involved in the gruesome murder, and as if that weren't enough, Whitney starts to believe that, pretty soon, he'll be next. But, will Luther take this dangerous situation lying down? Will he fight for justice and let the truth shine?â€”Nick Riganas

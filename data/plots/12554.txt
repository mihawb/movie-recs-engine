Viktor Burakov (Steven Rea) is a low-level police detective following a puzzling series of murders in his district. He believes they may be the work of a serial killer, but his Communist bosses don't agree. The Party line is that serial killing is a "decadent, Western phenomenon." But as the body count increases, Burakov notices a distinct pattern.He eventually catches up to the killer, but is stymied because the man is a low-level Communist Party member and the Party protects him. Eventually, Communism collapses and Burakov is appointed head of the investigation. He brings in a psychiatrist, who writes a deep analysis of the type of person involved. Burakov's superior contacts the FBI, discovering that Burakov is legendary because of his insight and dedication. They identify a man, Citizen Chikatilo and arrest him. The psychiatrist meets with Chikatilo and through his reactions, they realize he is the guilty party.

1990s LA police detective Mike Church took the case of amnesia-suffering mute client' Grace; she was having nightmares about the murder of a pianist named Margaret Strauss by her world-famous composer/conductor husband Roman Strauss in the late 1940s; Margaret had been suspicious that Roman's housekeeper Inga and her disturbed, stammering son Frankie were stealing her husband things; Roman was falsely put to death by electric chair for the murder of his wife Margaret, who was actually stabbed and murdered with a pair of scissors by Frankie, because his mother was in love with Roman; in the present day story, Mike came into contact with hypnotist/antique dealer Franklyn Madson who believed that Grace had suffered trauma in her past life; under regressive hypnosis, it was revealed that there were remarkable similarities and parallels between the stories of Roman and Margaret in the past, and Mike and Grace in the present; it was discovered that Mike was the reincarnation of murdered pianist wife, Margaret; and amnesia-suffering Grace was the reincarnation of executed composer Roman Strauss; the hypnotist (the murderer from the 40s) died when impaled on a large scissor sculpture made by 'Grace' and Mike held his partner 'Grace'.

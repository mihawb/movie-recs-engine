This is a fictional account of Ned Kelly's life starting in Australia, 1867, when Ned's a boy. His dad, originally sent from Ireland to an Australian prison colony by the English oppressors, gets arrested for killing a neighbor's cow that Ned killed. Ned saves a boy of rich parents from drowning in the river. The mother offers to pay so Ned can attend the same private boarding school her son attends and get a quality education. Ned's mom rejects it as an attempt of English oppression. When Ned runs off to tell his dad at his cell about his deed, his dad is dead. His mom sends him off with bushranger Harry Power to learn the trade and become a man. This includes shooting Sgt. O'Neil. Ned quits and returns home. He gets 3 years prison for the non-lethal shooting. He comes out of prison a young man and makes a living as a bare fist boxer. Visiting his mom, he returns the dresses his cross-dressing brother stole from a brothel. He meets Mary there. He later becomes an outlaw.â€”Scott Filtenborg

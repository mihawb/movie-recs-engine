With tough Gaokao just around the corner--a two-day, make-or-break national college entrance exam held annually in China--and an ongoing police investigation in school, the brilliant student, Chen Nian, already has enough on her plate. Coming from an impecunious, single-parent family, Chen Nian and her mother barely manage to eke out an existence, and as if that weren't enough, the privileged, spoiled, and ruthless classmate, Wei Lai, and her close-knit team of bullies, have picked her out, taking pleasure in making her life miserable. Then, as problems keep piling up, Xiao Bei, a young teenage thug, enters Chen Nian's complicated life, offering friendship and a sense of protection. However, can Chen Nian handle the pressure before it is too late?â€”Nick Riganas

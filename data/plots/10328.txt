Meet Art, Ben and Joe. Three simple, aging senior citizens who like to swim in an unguarded swimming pool next door from the old folks home they live in. So one day while they are swimming, they feel energized and "ready to take on the world!" What they don't know is that the pool was recently rented by four alien Antareans living incognito as humans. Art, Ben, Joe and their friends soon discover this and offer to help the Antareans return the cocoons back to Antarea; and as a reward, they are offered something unusually magnificent.â€”Dylan Self <robocoptng986127@aol.com>

The plot should read as follows;
The Little Death is a truly original comedy about sex, love, relationships and taboo. In a multi story narrative, we peer behind the closed doors of a seemingly normal suburban street. A woman with a dangerous fantasy and her partner's struggle to please her. A man who begins an affair by drugging his own wife without her knowing anything about it. A couple struggling to keep things together after a sexual experiment spins out of control. A woman who can only find sexual pleasure in her husband's pain. A call centre operator caught in the middle of a dirty and pornographic phone call. And the distractingly charming but dangerous new neighbour who connects them all. The little Death explores sexual fantasies, why we want them, how far we go to fulfill them and the hilarious and sometimes odd consequences to these fleeting moments of sexual ecstasy?

In Nablus, on the West Bank, there live two friends whove known each other for years. Said and Khaled, two Palestinian people, whove experienced living under another nations rule for their whole lives. They feel oppression, humiliation and consider themselves prisoners in their own land. As soon as a friend presents to them an opportunity to avenge their way of life, the filmmaker follows their steps as they prepare themselves for their final act of resistance, a suicide mission in Tel-Aviv.The movie focuses on the views of the two friends, and the people who accompany them during their final day. The men get ready to strike, and while they get shaven to look like Jewish settlers, they record their martyr video messages and converse about Koran passages. When they cross the fence to get into Israel, Said and Khaled are split up due to an Israeli patrol. Back at the Palestinian side of the fence, they keep searching each other, while Khaled silently grows doubts about what they are about to do.His doubts get encouraged by Suha, a modern Palestinian girl and the daughter of a well known martyr. She likes Said, but is unable to get trough to his feelings about his mission. After Khaled and Suha find Said at night, the two friends later decide to continue with their mission regardless of Suhas and Khaleds reservations. While in Tel-Aviv the next day, Khaleds doubts overcome him though and he wants to back out after all. Said needs to go on alone, and is to fulfil the mission to its end

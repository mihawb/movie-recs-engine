In New York, the yuppie newly promoted vice-president Charles Driggs meets the sexy and free-spirited "Lulu" after cheating a restaurant for fun. Lulu offers a ride for him in her convertible but she "abducts" Charles and they go to a motel in New Jersey, where they spend the night together. On the next morning, she heads to her hometown in Pennsylvania to spend the weekend with Charlie. When they arrive in her mother's home, she discloses her real name - "Audrey Hankel" - to him and she tells her mother that Charlie is her husband. In the night, they go to her high school reunion posing as husband and wife. But Audrey's ex-husband Ray Sinclair that has just been released from prison on parole meets her in the party. Audrey does not tell Charlie who Ray is and Charlie accepts Ray's invitation to drink some beer with him and his date Irene. After a while, Ray becomes violent, he hits Charlie, and he kidnaps Audrey. But Charlie does not intend to give up on her.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

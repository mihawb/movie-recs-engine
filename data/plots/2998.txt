In what is supposed to be an indictment of 1960's American society, two aimless young adults try to find themselves in the California desert. Mark is a college student who spends most of his time attending protest rallies. He's also taken to carrying a gun which gets him into big trouble when he is incorrectly identified as the shooter in a cop killing. To get out of town, he steals a small single-engine airplane. Daria works for a property owner planning a new development, but she heads into the desert to find a quiet place to meditate. When Mark and Daria meet, they have sex, travel a bit together, and otherwise spend their time idly wondering about life in general.â€”garykmcd

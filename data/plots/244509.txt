A terrified man Richard (Michael Hall) accidentally shoots a burglar inside his house. He is assured by the cop (Nick Damici) that it was purely self defense and the burglar was a wanted fella. Richard, shaken by the experience and not proud of the incident, visits the cemetery on the burglar's burial day and gets confronted by Ben, a paroled convict and the dead burglar's dad. Ben indirectly threatens and praises Richard's family photo, which he saw in the newspaper. The cops can't arrest Ben as he hasn't done anything and can't give Richard official police protection.â€”Fella_shibby@yahoo.com

In August 2005, in New Orleans, Nolan Hayes brings his pregnant wife Abigail with Eclampsia to the Saint Mary Hospital. Abigail delivers a premature baby and dies and the baby needs to be kept in a ventilator. A few hours later, Hurricane Katrina hits the hospital, cutting the power and the hospital is evacuated. Nolan stays with his daughter since the equipment is not portable and soon he finds that the battery is at the end of its life and only can hold three minutes of charge. He finds a battery charge and initially has to crank every three minutes. As time goes by, the battery holds less charge. But the situation gets worse when marauders invade the hospital.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

Bruel, Caussat, and Colin are three students at a boarding school. There is a continual battle between the school's authority figures and the students. The teachers and monitors are always giving the three in particular "zero for conduct" and Sunday detention for their behavior. Conversely, most of the students believe the headmaster, teachers and monitors are a combination of authoritarian, inept, and/or corrupt. The one exception among the teachers is Huguet, newly arrived to the school; he has a penchant for imitating Charles Chaplin as the Little Tramp, and doing handstands whenever the mood suits him, which includes in class. The boys are always doing whatever it takes to amuse themselves, and if it causes the teachers grief, so much the better. The three are the masterminds of a plot to overtake the school's Commemoration Day celebrations. The one student not involved is Tabard, who is seen as a sissy among the student body. Bruel believes Tabard should be involved, to show them he's truly "one of them."â€”Huggo

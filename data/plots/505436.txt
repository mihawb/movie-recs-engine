After Laure's blissful wedding in Serial Bad Weddings (2014), the unconventional Verneuils' multicultural family faces yet another unforeseen crisis. Against the backdrop of ambitious business ideas in a France that is constantly changing, the ethnic sons-in-law--the Algerian, Rachid, the Jewish David, the Chinese Chao, and the Ivorian Charles--now plan to move abroad with their lovely wives, leaving doting parents Claude and Marie all alone. The Koffis are also in for a big surprise. Will the Verneuils take the situation lying down? Above all, will they ever learn to stop worrying and trust their children?â€”Nick Riganas

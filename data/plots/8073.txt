Besotted with cheap crime fiction, cinema, and popular culture, bored-to-death English language students Franz and Arthur love to live in a dream world. Indeed, the pair of layabouts fancy themselves to be a gang. But, in the meantime, Franz and Arthur vie for the attention of their romantic classmate Odile, who naively tips them off about a mountain of cash stashed in an unlocked cabinet in Aunt Victoria's suburban house in Joinville-le-Pont. Of course, the amateur criminals take an immediate interest in wide-eyed Odile's incidental mention and start to iron out the details of an audacious robbery, just like in the movies. However, what happens if Arthur's uncle and all-powerful love stand in the way of the perfect heist?â€”Nick Riganas

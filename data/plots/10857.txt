Based on Raymond Briggs' book. An old British couple, Jim (Sir John Mills) and Hilda (Dame Peggy Ashcroft), who live in the countryside, believe in the fact that the Government will always know what it is doing. However, the world is fast heading for World War III between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Jim prepares for it by building a shelter using Goverment pamphlets. However, both of them still believe that the war will be fought like World War II, and they can't fully understand that the war will be fought with nuclear weapons. All too soon, war breaks out and Jim and Hilda survive a nuclear blast.â€”mykey accident

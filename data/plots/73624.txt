In 2011, João, also called Zero (Wagner Moura), is a brilliant physicist, but he spends his days deploring on the fateful night of twenty years earlier, when he was publicly betrayed and humiliated at a college party by his girlfriend, Helena (Alinne Moraes).
Although he is directing one of the largest scientific projects in Brazil, his eccentricities and stubbornness leave him at risk of being fired by his college colleague and current sponsor, Sandra (Maria Luiza Mendonça).
Aided by his best friend - and also a scientist - Otávio "Panda" (Fernando Ceylão), Zero activates the unfinished machine he developed to guarantee durable energy, as well as a new sustainable energy source for humanity.
To his surprise, the reaction caused by the machine proves that he is capable of opening a bridge to the past, taking him back to 1991, in the middle of that traumatic night when the beautiful Helena left him by the popular playboy Ricardo (Gabriel Braga Nunes).
Then, he sees that changing the facts can be more difficult and confusing than it seems, returning to an altered present, Zero discovers that his younger version used his knowledge about the future to become a powerful and corrupt businessman, even more so separated from Helena.
From the discoveries of the new future, he realizes that his only way out will be to return to the past once again and prevent himself from altering the present by trying to avoid paradoxes of time caused by the presence of three versions of himself in 1991.

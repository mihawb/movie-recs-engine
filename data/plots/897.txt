Leaving forever behind their gloomy, memory-laden home in the bamboo forest, a devastated Harihar, and his equally broken wife, Sarbojaya, move to the bustling holy city of early-1920s Benares, along with their silent son, Apu, after the life-altering events of Pather Panchali (1955). But, there, too, against the backdrop of unfulfilled dreams, and the steep ghats on the banks of the sacred Ganges River, a challenging, hand-to-mouth existence awaits the Ray family, burdening sad-eyed Sarbojaya with even more worries. Perhaps, the family can now wipe the slate clean and bury the past in the remote Bengal village of Mansapota; however, Apu nurtures aspirations beyond life as the community's priest, and after winning a scholarship to study at a prestigious university, he catches the train to Kolkata. But, goodbyes are never easy. Will Apu prove his worth, and spread his wings in the big, lively city of dreams?â€”Nick Riganas

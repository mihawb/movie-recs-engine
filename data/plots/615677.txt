When alien invaders kidnap Earth's superheroes, their kids are whisked away to a government safe house. But whip-smart tween Missy Moreno will stop at nothing to rescue her superhero dad, Marcus Moreno. Missy teams up with the rest of the superkids to escape their mysterious government babysitter, Ms. Granada. If they want to save their parents, they'll need to work together by using their individual powers--from elasticity to time control to predicting the future--and form an out-of-this-world team.â€”Netflix

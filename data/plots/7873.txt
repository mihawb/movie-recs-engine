After returning home from the Gulf War, Army Ranger Jim Davis (Christian Bale) is having a hard time adjusting to civilian life. Jim is suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and having flashbacks and nightmares of the killing he did during the war. Jim's money is running dry, and he is looking for a job. Jim wants to be a policeman, and he has applies for a job with the L.A.P.D. While waiting for the job to come through, Jim hangs out with his best friend and homie brother, Mike Alonzo (Freddy Rodriguez). Jim and Mike begin to cruise the mean streets of South Central, Los Angeles, and they fall back into their old life of crime. Jim doesn't get the job with the L.A.P.D., but he does get a job offer from Homeland Security. The only problem that Jim has in taking the job is that he can't get the war out of his mind.

Faced with a dreaded existential cul-de-sac and the prospect of a neat and entirely predictable life devoid of surprises, Julie finds herself with her back to the wall, forced to settle down. And, somehow, pushing thirty doesn't make things easier. So, to find meaning and purpose in life, Julie embarks on a long, challenging, twelve-chapter journey of love and enlightenment, hoping for the best. Little by little, as she puts her dormant talents to good use, Julie flirts with other men, throws herself into a new relationship, and gains new skills and experiences. After all, the burden of choice is not the problem. It is the quintessential factor that defines who we are as a person; it shows our character to the world.â€”Nick Riganas

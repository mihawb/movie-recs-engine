Mank captures the life of Mankiewicz between essentially 1933 and 1940, when America
was in the midst of the Depression and watching uneasily, but from far, the gathering
clouds of World War II. There is another presence that Fincher does well to focus on
in his telling of the making of Citizen Kane, the candidacy of Left-leaning Upton Sinclair
for the governorship of California, which sees the tinsel town gang up against him. As
Sinclair is portrayed as promoting "anti-American" values, with MGM lending its might
to a campaign that would now be described as fake news, Mank is forced to confront his
own compromises and little lies.In a marvelous scene, Dance's Hearst recounts Oldman's Mank the "parable of the organ
grinder's monkey", just after the latter has humiliated himself and Hearst in a drunken
rant about the sold idealism of the newspaper baron. While the monkey thinks it is him
running the show, Hearst reminds Mank, he has to "dance", "every time", the music plays.That realization is a glimpse of the bitterness that would eventually lead Mank to finding
himself jobless in Hollywood, particularly after his decision to take on Hearst with Welles'
backing. It would also lead him to Citizen Kane - while on the bed with a broken leg, away
from friends and family and fighting for a drink despite alcohol slowly claiming him - as well
as his only Oscar.As Mank explains it to a friend, "We have got a huge responsibility, to people in the dark willingly checking their disbelief at the door."

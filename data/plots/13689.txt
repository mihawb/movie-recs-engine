The story is about a young gymnast Dan Millman played by Scott Mechlowicz, and his struggle to make sense of his life in which he is successful but still unfulfilled. By chance he meets his "Yoda"/Shaolin priest/Boss Paul who helps him "git his haid straight" after which he goes on to be comfortable with his athletic prowess albeit not exactly Olympic caliber.
When one is successful, one does not have the time and patience to look back or forward. Dan is leading his life in chase of a dream - to get a gold in the Olympics. He and his coach knows that he is the best, but still inside he too knows that something is missing. It was in one of his sleepless nights that he meets a petrol pump attender who changes his life - step by step. He also realizes the change but he is not ready to let go the garbage within him. As the petrol pump attenders says "I call myself a Peaceful Warrior... because the battles we fight are on the inside." The movie takes a u turn when Dam meets with an accident - where his leg bone just shatters, it is not only the leg that breaks but also his heart to go forward for his only love- the Olympics."A warrior does not give up what he loves, he finds the love in what he does."
Socrates(as Dam calls him), the petrol pump attender teaches the guy to find his long lost love and dream. But towards the end he finds the hard truth that Socrates was a illusionist character - whose sole purpose of life was to take Dan to his dream and make him prepared to win the battle within him.
This is almost a "Rocky IX" type movie with a wonderful happy ending.

Mal struggles with her new celebrity life as the girlfriend of King Ben, putting a spell on her hair making it blonde, and maintaining a princess-like personality that she is uncomfortable with. She admits her issues to her friends Evie, Carlos, and Jay, but they are content with their new lives in Auradon and do not wish to return to the Isle of the Lost. Evie scolds Mal for relying on her mother's spell book to solve her issues. Carlos, wishing to ask Jane to the upcoming Cotillion dance, turns to Mal for help to be honest with her. Mal gives him a sweet that will make him speak the truth, but his dog Dude eats it, magically speaking the truth in English and very frankly as a result. Then Dude becomes a talking dog and Carlos and his friends are surprised with the result. At the Cotillion, Uma, daughter of Ursula, spells Ben to fall in love with her and Ben says to bring down the barrier. Mal breaks the spell with a true love's kiss, but Uma turns into an octopus and Mal turns into a dragon to fight her. Everyone, including Ben, is surprised with this metamorphosis. Ben jumps into the water and makes a deal with Uma. So, Evie, Ben, Jay, and Carlos go to the Isle of the Lost to convince Mal to come back to Auradon. While they are on the Isle, Ben tries to act like a villain, but only succeeds after Evie, Jay, and Carlos sing a song to him and teach Ben how to chill like a villain. When Mal agrees to come back, Harry Hook, son of Captain Hook, captures Ben, but Mal and her friends find a way to get Ben back. At the end, the kingdom has a party to celebrate Mal's return.

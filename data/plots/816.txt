Swinging London, 1967. Having thwarted an ambitious assassination plan by his arch-nemesis, Dr Evil, the British super-agent and fun-loving hedonist, Austin Powers, has himself cryogenically frozen, just in case the world ever required his services again. But three long decades later, pure evil threatens the world again, and now, the time is ripe to thaw Powers out. Feeling like a fish out of water, the bespectacled hero tries to find his feet in a strange new world and joins forces with his brilliant new sidekick, Vanessa Kensington. However, a lot has changed since the 1960s. Can Austin Powers, the international man of mystery, thwart despicable Dr Evil's efforts for world domination once again?â€”Nick Riganas

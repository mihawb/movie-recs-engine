Parisian screw-up urchins Mickey, Donald, and Goofy can barely keep out of trouble for a day, but since gallant musketeer saved Mickey and gave him his plumed hat as a token they may one day join the glorious French royal elite regiment, they dream of enlisting. Guards captain Peg-leg, who dreams of usurping the throne, cruelly laughs them away as butterfingers midgets of no use. yet, when haughty Minnie, whom he needs to wed to legitimate his coup, demands her own bodyguard, which mighty actually protect her, he decides to enlist and propose the bumbling trio, confident he and masked accomplices can easily eliminate and blame those.â€”KGF Vissers

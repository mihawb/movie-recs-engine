Okwe is an irregular Nigerian immigrant leading a hard life and struggling to survive in London's underground. He works as a hotel receptionist by night and, as he has a medical degree, he practices some medicine during the day, in a very odd way. Besides that he must constantly escape from Immigration officers. One day Okwe discovers that an illegal scheme of surgeries is being lead by Juan, his boss at the hotel. Juan comes up with a tempting proposal: if Okwe agrees to perform the illegal surgeries he makes a lot of money and gets legal citizenship in the U.K. Can Okwe keep his moral values intact?—Weslley Gonçalves

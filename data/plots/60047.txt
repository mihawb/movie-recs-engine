Ottone is a shopkeeper in a pet-shop. During a trip to the Maldives, he tells a psychoanalyst his history with women. Mara had left him for a butcher; Barbara, his best friend, betrays her man and leaves him; Luna, beautiful and rich, wants him just for sex; Lorenza, the owner of the shop, would like to run away with him.â€”Adalberto Fornario

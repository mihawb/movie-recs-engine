By an extraordinary amalgamation of pure chance and divine intervention, the dedicated Miami Police Detective, Kung Fury, is granted a set of unprecedented and out-of-this-world martial arts skills, crowning him the undisputed King of Kung Fu. But, when an unscrupulous foe, the unstoppable Kung Führer, does away with the precinct's chief, Kung Fury swears revenge. Now, he has no other choice but to track down the megalomaniac assassin, even if his decision sends him back in time, deep into the heart of evil Nazi Germany. Kung Fury: He is lethal. He is fearless. He will get even.—Nick Riganas

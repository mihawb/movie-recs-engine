In Reno, Nevada, 30-year-old Roslyn Tabor (Marilyn Monroe) has filed for a quickie six-week Nevada divorce from her inattentive husband Raymond (Kevin McCarthy). As Roslyn is entering the Washoe County Courthouse with her best friend and landlord Isabel (Thelma Ritter), she ignores Raymond's attempts to talk to her and reconcile. Isabelle is also a divorcee.After the divorce papers are filed, Isabelle takes Roslyn to a cocktail lounge at Harrah's Reno Hotel-Casino for drinks, to let the reality of her new divorce sink in. While at Harrah's, they meet an aging cowboy named Gaylord 'Gay' Langland (Clark Gable) and his tow truck driver best friend Guido (Eli Wallach). After some good conversation, they invite Roslyn and Isabelle to Guido's old house in the Nevada countryside to help her forget about the divorce, after Gay tells Roslyn that he is also divorced. The group arrives at the unfinished house Guido built for his late wife, who died several years earlier during childbirth. They all drink and dance. Roslyn has too much to drink, so Gay drives her home to Reno.Eventually, Roslyn and Gay move into Guido's half-finished house and start to work on it. One day after breakfast, Gay tells Roslyn how he wishes he were more of a father to his own children, whom he has not seen for some years. Later that afternoon, Roslyn and Gay argue when Gay discovers a rabbit has been eating the lettuce in the garden. Gay states his intention to find and kill the rabbits which have been eating the vegetable garden they planted outside Guido's house.When Guido and Isabelle later show up at the house, Gay suggests that they round up wild mustangs to sell. They then plan to go to a local rodeo in Dayton to look for and hire a third man for the job. In Dayton, they run into Perce Howland (Montgomery Clift), a cowboy friend of Gay's, who is in Dayton to compete in the rodeo. Gay offers to pay for the broke Perce's $10 rodeo entry fee if he helps the group round up wild mustangs the next day. Isabelle sees her ex-husband Charles and his new wife Clara, and decides to invite them to her Reno boarding house home instead of going to the rodeo with Gay, Guido, Perce, and Roslyn. Before the rodeo, Guido, Perce, Roslyn and Gaylord all drink at a Dayton bar, where wagers were made and won on Roslyn's ability to play a game of paddle ball. The group is nearly involved in a fist fight when a drunken patron at the bar spanks Roslyn's bottom as she plays paddle-ball.At the rodeo, Roslyn becomes somewhat upset when Guido tells her how the horses are made to buck with an irritating flank strap. She then declares that all rodeos should be banned. Later in the rodeo, Perce is thrown by a bucking horse and Roslyn begs him to go to a hospital, but he insists on riding a bull he had already signed up and paid to ride. He gets thrown again, resulting in a head injury.Later that afternoon, after Roslyn dances with Perce, he passes out in a Dayton back alley. When he regains consciousness, he sees Roslyn crying over him. He says that he never had anyone cry for him before and that he wished he had a friend to talk to. He tells her how his mother changed after his father died, giving his stepfather the ranch Perce's father wanted to leave to Perce. A drunken Gay then fetches Roslyn, telling her that he wants her to meet his kids, whom he claims he unexpectedly ran into. When Gay discovers his children have already left Dayton, he causes a public scene outside the bar in Dayton.Later on, during the drive home to Reno that evening, a drunken Guido asks if Roslyn has left Gay, and offers to take his place. Back at Guido's house, Guido, intoxicated and sleepless, attempts to finish the patio he started. Perce awakens and nearly tears his bandages off, forgetting about his recent injury. Roslyn puts him to bed and sits down with Gay. He asks her if a woman like her would ever want to have a child with him. She avoids the issue, and Gay goes to bed.The next day, Gay, Guido and Perce prepare to go after the wild mustangs, and Roslyn reluctantly tags along. Guido flies his biplane into a valley and spots a group of horses which he uses his plane to chase them out of the valley and onto the plain where Gay, Perce and Roslyn are. After the men catch a stallion and four mares, Rosalyn becomes upset when she learns that the mustangs will be sold and slaughtered for dog food. She then tells Gay she did not know she was falling in love with a killer. Gay tells Roslyn that he did things for her that he never did for any other woman, such as making the house a home, and planting the garden.After the horses are captured, Roslyn begs Gay to release the horses. He considers doing it, but when she offers to pay him the $200 she won playing paddle-ball, it angers him. Guido tells Roslyn that he would let them go if she would leave Gay for him. She rebuffs him, telling him he only cares about himself. Perce also asks her if she wants him to set the horses free, but she declines because she thinks it would only start a fight.That night, Perce wakes up Roslyn and they free the stallion anyway. After Gay chases down and subdues the horse all by himself, he lets it go and says he just did not want anybody making up his mind for him. With Guido angrily yelling at Gay for letting the horses get away, Perce tries to calm him down, while Gay and Roslyn get into Gay's truck to drive back home. As they are driving, Roslyn tells Gay that she will move out the next day. Gay stops the truck to pick up his dog from Guido's parked biplane, and watches Roslyn joyfully untethering it. Gay and Roslyn realize that they still love each other, and they drive off into the night.

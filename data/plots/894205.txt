Following the death of their fearless leader, Ulysses Bloodstone, a team of elite monster hunters gathers at the towering Bloodstone Manor. It's now time for the trackers--including the cursed aristocrat Jack Russell and the patriarch's estranged daughter Elsa--to prepare for a ceremonial hunt to determine who will wield the Blood Gem: a mysterious, alien relic with unfathomable powers. However, as the fragrant scent of warm, bright-red blood fills the air, the masks will fall off. And on a restless, moonlit night like this, there can only be one keeper of the sacred Bloodstone. Who will take over as the monster slayers' new chief?â€”Nick Riganas

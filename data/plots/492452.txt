Junkie Ben Burns finally manages to get out of residential therapy to spend the holidays with his family, against staff advice. His mother Holly is excited to extend the warmest welcome to her firstborn, but kid sister Ivy gloomily predicts he'll fuck up for all of them, just as every previous visit. It starts fairly well, albeit Holly watching Ben every second is most irritating. Alas people recognizing him are mainly hostile, or a danger of drawing him back into drugs. After a while, temptation proves too strong and someone even abducted the family dog Ponce. Holly drives Ben along people who hate him enough to do so, thus putting themselves in acute danger, until Ben makes his desperate move.â€”KGF Vissers

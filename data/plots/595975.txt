Sadly, Victor, an unemployed sixty-year-old cartoonist, feels that his marriage is failing. Having admitted that things cannot be improved, sad-eyed Victor seems to have come to terms with the course of events, while his wife, Marianne, is bent on having a blast, with or without him. Then, Antoine, a young screenwriter and owner of a company that stages historical re-enactments with pinpoint accuracy, offers Victor a unique form of time travel. Now, with the help of his expertise, Victor can relive the most important day of his life: the day he met the love of his life at the cosy La Belle Époque café in Lyon, four long decades earlier. Indeed, things were much simpler back then; however, can Victor rewrite people exactly as he would like them to stay?—Nick Riganas

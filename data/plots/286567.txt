The teenager Max McGrath and his mother Molly McGrath return to their house in their hometown that they left when his famous father, the scientist Jim McGrath, died during a storm. Max is lonely at school but when he is hit in his bicycle by the truck of his mate Sofia Martinez, he befriends her. Soon he knows Jim's partner in the N-TEK company and friend Dr. Miles Edwards at home since his mother has invited him to have dinner with them. Out of the blue, Max sees fluid energy around his hand and then he meets the amnesiac alien Steel, who saves him from blowing-up absorbing his energy. Max learns that he is a power generator and Steel is capable to absorb his excessive energy. Further, Earth is in danger since the alien breed Ultralink is threatening the planet, and Max has powers and an armor when joining with Steel. In flashbacks, he learns about the work of his past and what really happened to him.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

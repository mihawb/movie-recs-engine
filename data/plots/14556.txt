The family man and school teacher Julien Auclert has his life turned upside down when his beloved wife Lisa is arrested, accused for murdering her boss, and sent to the prison. Along three years, Julien raises their son Oscar alone and appeals to the court; however, the evidences against Lisa are solid - the motive, since she had and argument with her boss; her fingerprints in the murder weapon, a fire extinguisher; blood stain in her coat; and a witness that saw her leaving the parking lot - and her lawyer exhausts all the possible resources in justice. Julien believes in the innocence of his wife and interviews Henri Pasquet, a former escapee from prison, to learn how to plan a prison break. Then he plots a scheme to release Lisaa and travel abroad with Oscar and her. However, he needs documents for the family; an escape plan; and lots of money. When Julien is informed that Lisa will be transferred to another prison within the next three days, he needs to raise a large amount and anticipate his strategy before the transference.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

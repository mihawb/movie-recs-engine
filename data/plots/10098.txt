Faced with raising her fatherless son alone, an unmarried single mother abandons her baby. As one thing leads to another, The Tramp (1915) crosses paths with the child on a street corner, and just like that, the carefree vagabond reluctantly becomes his surrogate father. However, so much can change in five years. Now, the tight-knit pair runs a glazing business, utterly unaware that their already fragile happiness is at stake. But who knows what the future has in store for the bright-eyed kid?â€”Nick Riganas

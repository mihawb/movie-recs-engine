Alice lives in a beautiful villa. She has a husband who makes a lot of money, a nine-year-old son, and three servants who happen to be immigrants. She is superficial, haughty, and racist. But everything changes the day her husband gets killed in an accident and the young widow finds herself debt-ridden. Forced to leave their magnificent house, she goes to live in a small apartment in a working-class neighborhood. To repay her debts she must also find work. When she gets to know Eva, a call girl who works in the town's West End, she follows her example. In parallel, during her free time, Alice meets a certain number of good people in her new area--and she feels closer and closer to one of them: Giulio.â€”Guy Bellinger

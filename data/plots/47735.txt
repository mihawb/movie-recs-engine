In Stockholm, nineteen year old Harry Lund and eighteen year old Monika Eriksson enter into a passionate relationship quickly after their formal meeting. They both live with their respective parents - Harry's mother who died about ten years ago, while his father is in ill health - and both work entry level blue collar jobs, Harry as a packing clerk for a china/glass company, it a job he is not very good at due not being very careful around the breakables, and Monika as a general clerk at a greengrocer. While Harry is at least committed to employment which he sees as a step to responsible adulthood, Monika wants to escape what she considers her terrible life, which includes getting away both from her parents and her job. Easily falling into helping Monika over all else, Harry decides to "escape" their respective lives with her. The primary question then becomes if there is a long term future for the pair as Monika's first priority is her own happiness, which at this stage of her life primarily means having fun, which may not be the easiest thing to accomplish on Harry's dime, especially as his money begins to run out.â€”Huggo

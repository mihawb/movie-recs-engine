Opening scene makes you think this is a movie right out of the 60s/70s as the cheesy audio rolls in with a man riding on a train after he gets off he is exposed to a town gone mad as there is rampant crime everywhere and watches at the mayor beheads a man and makes everyone watch. Rutger tries to ignore the horrific things going around him as his one true goal in life is to own a lawnmower, but the only way he can get money is by eating broken glass as a twisted camera man films it for a more brutal version of bum fights. Armed with the $50 he needed to buy a lawnmower Rutger goes to buy it when the store is robbed, after seeing one of the men point a gun at a baby Rutger is over powered by his sense of righteous justice and grabs a shot gun off of a stand, right next to the lawnmower, and blows all three men away and then pays for the gun and promptly goes on a cleaning spree taking out whoever he deems bad enough to killand its not a short list. After 10 or so kills the mayor gets fed up and then he starts to take out his lackeys, I mean sons, and they have a show down and all too quick its over, but I dont want to give anything away.

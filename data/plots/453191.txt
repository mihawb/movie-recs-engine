After putting the finishing touches to their ambitious project, the Fox and his companions put on a three-part play to entertain the inhabitants of the farm. Starting with "A Baby To Deliver", an exhausted stork carrying baby Pauline crash-lands at Pig's fragrant garden. To help him deliver the precious cargo to its expectant parents, the Pig and his clumsy assistants, the Rabbit and the Duck, embark on a time-sensitive mission to finish the job. How hard can it be? Next up, in "The Big Bad Fox", the Fox takes the local Wolf's advice to steal three eggs from the Chicken and raise them into chickens. But when the cute chicks hatch and imprint on Fox, thinking he's their mother, the Fox will find himself at a crossroads. Will the Fox follow his heart? Finally, in "We Must Save Christmas", the Duck and the Rabbit join forces to save Christmas after an unfortunate incident. Can the clumsy duo help Santa deliver the longed-for presents to all the children?â€”Nick Riganas

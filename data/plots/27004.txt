In Chicago, Sam Phelan and his wife Leslie are facing financial problems to pay their mortgage after a period of unemployment. While driving his old Buick below an overpass, a case falls onto the hood of the car and he finds that there are more than six hundred thousand dollars inside. Sam and Leslie quit their job; pay their mortgage; buy a Land Rover; and refurnish their house. Meanwhile a British criminal (Pyke Kubic) arrives from London to visit his brother Reeve in jail. He tells his brother that he threw the stolen money away to destroy the evidences of the heist, and saw a Caucasian in an old car retrieving the case. Pyke chases and finds Sam and partially retrieves the money, but more than seventy-four thousand dollars have been spent by the greedy couple and Pyke wants them to refund the amount in five days.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

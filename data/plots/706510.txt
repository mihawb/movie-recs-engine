Wesley is out of a job and talking about sex at a Catholic school job interview (17th) doesn't help. She's also out of a boyfriend. But she has her two BFFs. She falls into the arms of a great guy and decides to repress her personality to keep him. When she hasn't heard from him in 5 days, she and her two BFFs, all drunk, write and send him a nasty email. He calls from a Mexican hospital just out of a coma. It's now a race for the 3 guilty women to get to his Cabo resort and find his room and phone before him and delete the email. Easier said than done. They get a room there. She bumps into her latest LA blind date at the resort.â€”Scott Filtenborg

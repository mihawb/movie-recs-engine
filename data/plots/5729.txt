Bunuel's first feature has more of a plot than Un chien andalou (1929), but it's still a pure Surrealist film, so this is only a vague outline. A man and a woman are passionately in love with each other, but their attempts to consummate that passion are constantly thwarted by their families, the Church, and bourgeois society.â€”Michael Brooke <michael@everyman.demon.co.uk>

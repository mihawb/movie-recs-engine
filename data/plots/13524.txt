Fictionalized account of the battle of the Ardennes in December 1944. An intelligence officer, Lt. Col. Dan Riley, is convinced that the Germans are amassing tanks and troops for an attack but he can't get anyone to believe him. When the attack is finally launched, he correctly deduces that a shortage of petrol will lead the tanks to a massive Allied fuel depot. Along the way, we encounter a number of characters including a green Lieutenant in his first battle, the grizzled American tank commander who is worried about his black market operation and a group of German soldiers posing as American MP's.â€”garykmcd

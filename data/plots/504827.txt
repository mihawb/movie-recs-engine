Bob Belcher and his wife, Linda, own a burger restaurant known for its incredible and unusual burger combinations. One day, they have trouble making payments to the bank, and are denied an extension on their loan. Bob wonders how things could possibly get any worse. He doesn't have to wait very long; a giant sinkhole suddenly appears in front of Bob's Burgers! Bob and Linda are told that it won't be long before the hole is filled, but their daughter accidentally falls in and discovers a dead body. The sinkhole quickly turns into a crime scene, and it looks like the bank will foreclose before customers can enter their restaurant again. When Bob and Linda's landlord is charged with murder, their children, Tina, Gene, and Louise, set off to save their family's restaurant by proving their landlord is innocent and bringing the real murderer to justice!

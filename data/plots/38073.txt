Erin's 31, a journalism grad student at Stanford and, for the summer, an intern at a New York daily. She meets Garrett at a bar, they hit it off, and, for the rest of the summer, are inseparable. But, can the relationship grow - or even survive - at a distance? Erin, who put her professional life on hold once before for a man, gets advice from her married sister, Corinne, and he gets running commentary from his best friend Box and his roommate Dan - both clueless about women. Garrett, who doesn't much like his job at a record company, looks for work in the Bay Area, Erin tries to find a reporting job in New York, but as these efforts fail, is there any hope for them as a couple?â€”<jhailey@hotmail.com>

Based on a true story, North Face is a survival drama film about a competition to climb the most dangerous rock face in the Alps. Set in 1936, as Nazi propaganda urges the nation's Alpinists to conquer the unclimbed North Face of the Swiss massif--the Eiger--two reluctant German climbers begin their daring ascent.—Irishlass240 (smmorr240@al.com)

After a terrible tragedy in King Triton's once-happy undersea kingdom of Atlantica, the dejected ruler decrees that all music be banned from his realm. Almost a decade later, Princess Ariel--the most rebellious of Triton's seven charming daughters who still cannot understand why her father is against melody--sneaks out one night, only to discover an illegal speakeasy brimming with music. Excited, Ariel wants more; however, with a headstrong father and a vigilant nanny, she has her work cut out for her. Can Ariel, the little mermaid, restore happiness and harmony to Atlantica?â€”Nick Riganas

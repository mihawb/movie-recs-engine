Fatal is now a huge star. Millions of fans, dozens of hits, 4 Music Music Awards of the best artist of the year, a clothing line, a magazine and soon opening its own amusement park: Fataland. It is the undisputed N ° 1. Apparently everything is going well - but in reality, Fatal no longer knows where he is going, because he no longer knows where he comes from: from his beginnings he makes believe that he grew up in the ghetto. When in fact he was born in a small village of Savoy, in the heart of the Alps. But we can not be a "gansta" when we are a son of shepherds of Savoy, then Fatal has preferred to hide its origins and forget its past .—OzzyPsycko

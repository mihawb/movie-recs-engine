Young Lucas (Paulo Sousa) lives with the religious aunt Lourdes (Juliana Zancanaro) in a quiet country town. He helps his aunt promote cults with the region's beats in the living room by playing the biblical songs on his keyboard. But this little agitated life is with the days counted when the charitable aunt announces the arrival of another nephew Mario (Thiago Cazado), just out of jail. The clash of reality between the cousins would only be summoned up in embarrassing situations, were it not for the unexpected attraction that ends up happening among the boys.

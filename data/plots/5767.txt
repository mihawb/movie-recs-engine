Joanna and her architect husband, Mark Wallace have been married for a decade, and their relationship's become very rocky. As they drive from their London home to St. Tropez for the unveiling of a house Mark has designed for his clients, Maurice and Francoise Dalbret, they recall the events - both happy and sad, which neither then to this point. Told in flashback they pair recall their first meeting, and memorable moments in their courtship and early wedded life, as well as the tensions they both felt which led them each to extramarital affairs. With a terrific score by Henry Mancini, this welli-loved Stanley Donnen film's a sparkling effervescent story which deals in an atypical way for films of this time - showing both the joyousness and pathos off love.â€”Huggo

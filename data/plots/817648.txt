Two years after a Super Bowl win, a scandal, and a suspension, New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton returns to his hometown and tries to reconnect with his 12-year-old son by coaching his Pop Warner football team. Payton was suspended in 2012 for his role in the team's Bountygate scandal where bounties were allegedly being paid to players who would try to injure players from the opposing team.

When the Druid Panoramix falls from a tree on the floor, he breaks his foot and decides to find a young successor to teach the secret of the magic potion to keep the village protected. He travels through Gaul with Astérix, Obélix and his young apprentice Pectine seeking out a good druid to learn his secret. Meanwhile the evil Sulfurix becomes the advisor of the ambitious Teleferix expecting to learn the secret of the magic potion to negotiate with Cesar while the Roman troops attack the village that is protected only by the Gallic women.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

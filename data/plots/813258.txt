It's business as usual after the sun-kissed adventure in Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation (2018), and Count Dracula has a lot on his plate already. But, as if that weren't enough, Tinkles, little Dennis' cuddly but indomitable pet from Puppy!: A Hotel Transylvania Short (2017), is looking for someone to play fetch with. Now, to channel the endless supply of energy of the lively canine giant, the always-busy head of Hotel Transylvania (2012) attempts to find a suitable playmate for his grandson's furry companion; however, that's easier than done. Is there a friend out there for Dennis' monster pet?â€”Nick Riganas

In medieval Verona, Italy, Rosaline, the witty daughter of Adrian Capulet, only has eyes for handsome Romeo Montague, her poetic Prince Charming. More than anything, Rosaline wants to leave the nest to experience life and love to the fullest. Instead, lovely Rosaline must dodge marriage proposals and the pesky suitors her father keeps throwing her way. Then her luminous, bright-eyed cousin Juliet enters the picture, and just like that, Rosaline is history. Now Romeo can't live without Juliet. Why does life have to be so complicated? Can lovesick Rosaline find it in her heart to move on after getting dumped? Or can she keep the new lovers apart?â€”Nick Riganas

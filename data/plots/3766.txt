Without a work assignment in New York City, Irish seaman Michael O'Hara, having met her earlier and immediately attracted to her, acts the Good Samaritan to beautiful Elsa Bannister in Central Park. Michael's actions result in her being able to convince her older attorney husband, the lame Arthur Bannister, to offer Michael a job aboard their yacht in they sailing back to their home base of San Francisco via the Panama Canal. Michael is reluctant to take the job as although he is attracted to her and believes she is attracted to him, he also believes Elsa to be dangerous, but can also see that she is scared, perhaps of Arthur, enough for him to take the job. As Michael ponders an unusual proposition by Arthur's business partner George Grisby, who is making the journey with them, Michael will find who he should and shouldn't trust as he fights for his life.â€”Huggo

For reasons unknown, the troubled teacher of an experimental, twelve-member group of teenage geniuses commits suicide in front of his entire classroom. A few days later, the long-term, forty-year-old substitute teacher, Pierre Hoffman, takes over for the rest of the school year, and right from the start, he notices a bizarre undercurrent of icy arrogance stemming from precocious Apolline and her small, close-knit clique. Already covering next year's material, and intent on wasting no more time after the incident, Apolline, and her friends, are cutting themselves off from the rest of the school, engaging in activities that resemble the creepy rituals of a sect. But, what lies beneath their strange and hostile behaviour? Is this the result of the shocking death, or is there a dark secret hidden in plain sight waiting to be revealed?â€”Nick Riganas

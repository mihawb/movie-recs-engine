With the taste of failure in his mouth; on the run from the police, and with a dying accomplice in his hands, the wounded brute gangster, Dickie, will eventually discover the perfect hideout: a magnificent and seemingly deserted castle by the sea, now home of the feeble ex-factory owner, George, and his frivolous French wife, Teresa. Home-invaded and forced to go along with Dickie's orders, the unlikely fellowship will wait for the next morning to get help; instead, an unexpected visit from the obnoxious Fairweathers and their friends will be, indeed, the last straw. In the end, penniless, manipulated, and on the verge of a glorious emotional breakdown, the always coward George must--for once in his life--find the courage to defend his fortress, and his remaining dignity. But, has he the strength to do it?â€”Nick Riganas

Former USMC Special Forces captain Eddie Deacon is out for any job stat, to reunite his family later. He's engaged as minimal wage security guard in a large shopping mall off town, proudly 'commanded' by handsome, huge fighting virgin Vance, who lets the rest get away with sloppiness. On their first nocturnal watch, Eddie opens after closing time to let in freaking girl Jamie, who claims to be persecuted by killers, as she's the key eye-witness in an impending mob trial, barely escaped from a bloodily attacked FBI convoy. Vance soon wisely steps aside to let Edie take charge of their defense as their is a small army of thugs laying siege under the cynical command of one Charlie, whose offer to let everyone go if Jamie is delivered is refused. Even the klutz guards now must step up to fight the experienced goons for survival, or die trying bravely.â€”KGF Vissers

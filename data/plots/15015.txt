Locked up in an impenetrable stone castle to serve the wicked and envious witch, Gothel, the young flaxen-haired girl, Rapunzel, can only dream of another life far away from the dense forest, and its fearsome dragon-guardian, Hugo. However, the unexpected discovery of a secret exit will pave the way for a wonderful adventure in the nearby kingdom, and a chance encounter with the charming Prince Stefan. Can Gothel keep Rapunzel forever imprisoned? Will Rapunzel's only friends--the cute white rabbit, Hobie, and the kind purple dragon, Penelope--help her find freedom and true love?â€”Nick Riganas

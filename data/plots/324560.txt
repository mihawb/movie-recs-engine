"Brimstone" is an epic thriller set in the Old West, a triumphant tale of powerful womanhood and resistance against a violent past that refuses to fade. Liz is a mute young woman who lives with her husband and two children. She is a midwife who communicates through sign language, sometimes assisted by her daughter. Her relationship with her 4-year-old son could be better, but otherwise Liz's life seems pretty good. When the new Reverend climbs the pulpit in church, Liz freezes, immediately knowing that she and her family are in great danger. The four chapters depict not only how the Reverend tries to takes everything Liz loves away from her, but also how her life unfolded in the past. "Brimstone" is a genre-bending film that draws inspiration from the American Southern Gothic genre, but also has a strong foothold in Dutch religious culture.â€”N279 Entertainment

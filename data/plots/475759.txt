In futuristic 2048 Los Angeles, the combat medic Nexus-8 replicant, Sapper Morton, heads to the city centre to sell his high-protein artificial nematodes, one year before the events of Blade Runner 2049 (2017). But there, gentle Morton catches the attention of a sadistic group of thugs who, after trying to assault his homeless friend, Ella, and her mother, lure him into a trap, forcing him to engage in a deadly fight. However, as Sapper flees the scene, someone in the shadows has witnessed everything. Is Morton's future at stake?â€”Nick Riganas

Zequi, a recently-released bank robber, goes to recover stolen money buried by his ditzy accomplice before going to jail. When they return to the site, they discover that Frida Kahlo High has built a gymnasium over the loot. Zequi decides to pose as a substitute teacher for a school that can't seem to keep any teachers around. Zequi comes in ready to lay down the law, but he quickly realizes that life on the inside might have been easier than dealing with wild, rebellious teenagers.â€”Pantelion Films

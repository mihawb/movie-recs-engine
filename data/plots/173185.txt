Alice Lantins, 38-year-old ambitious workaholic editor of "Rebelle" fashion magazine, returns to Paris from Brazil and loses her flash-memory on the plane. Young architecture student Balthazar Apfel finds it and calls Alice to tell her. She schedules a meeting in the bar where Balthazar is drinking with his friends but he tells her that the device is at home. He offers a ride in his scooter to Alice and while he is putting the spare helmet on her, two coworkers of Alice see from an angle that make them believe that Balthazar is kissing Alice. They take a photo and post it on the Twitter. The next morning, everybody is laughing at Alice, but the chief editor, her boss Vincent Khan, loves the idea that Alice is dating someone 20 years younger. Alice decides to pretend that she is in love with Balthazar to get a promotion at the magazine. But she soon learns that she should not trifle with love.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

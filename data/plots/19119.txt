American Harry Fabian is a small time hustler in London, his loyal wife, Mary Bristol, who is aware of his activities but probably not that they are truly unethical, amoral scams. Their life centers on the Silver Fox, a nightclub owned by Philip Nosseross, and largely managed by his wife, Helen Nosseross, Mary a singer there, and Harry who works his scams out of the club with the Nosserosses getting a cut. While Harry embarks on these scams, he always has the thought of bigger payouts, although he is never able to convince anyone to provide him with the few hundred quid seed money to carry out those bigger plans. Things change when he is trying to find investors for his latest big plan, namely to corner the market on exhibition wrestling in London by exploiting what he learns is a disagreement between father and son, Gregorius and Hermes Kristo, the former a traditional Greco-Roman wrestler, the latter a professional wrestling promoter. Helen wants to exploit the situation herself in trying to use Harry's plan to get away from Philip, who she never loved and truly detests, in wanting to open her own club without him. While loving Helen, Philip may understand his wife more than she realizes. As Harry, Helen and Philip's plans, some which are more open than others, are in direct conflict with each other, those conflicts may lead to collateral damage as each strives for what he/she wants, that damage not only to those directly involved, but also to Mary who wants to be part of Harry's salvation.â€”Huggo

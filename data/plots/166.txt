13-year-old Vic is new in her high school. She soon makes friends with Penelope and they check out guys together, in the quest for a great love. Then Vic's parents complicate her life by not allowing her to attend the "boum," a big party. But with help from Grand-mere Poupette, Vic is allowed to go, and she falls in love with Matthieu. Meanwhile, her parents' marriage is on the edge when her father's ex-girlfriend demands one last night with him.â€”Tom Zoerner <Tom.Zoerner@informatik.uni-erlangen.de>

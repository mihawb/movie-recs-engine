When the accident-prone daughter of a French businessman disappears in Mexico and the detective sent down to find her returns empty-handed, the businessman's company psychologist comes up with an unusual plan - send someone equally accident-prone to find her. Despite detective Campana's objections and disbelief in bad luck, he and Francois Perrin, the accident-prone man in question, are teamed up and head back down to Mexico to pick up the girl's trail.â€”Tony Scheinman

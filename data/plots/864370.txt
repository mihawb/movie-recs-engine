My name is Ruo-Nan, the reason why I'm making this video is I hope that people could help me lift the curse bestowed upon my daughter after watching what I have to say. Because of my ignorance, I never thought that it was my actions that brought the curse. The following content may contain certain hidden dangers and risks, which includes myself retelling the horrifying encounters that happened six years ago. 6 years ago, I set up a studio "Ghostbusters" with my boyfriend and my journalism classmates, we aimed to break myths of superstitions and shared them on our blog. One day, an urgent notice arrived from my boyfriend's home, calling him to return for an ancient cult ritual that occurs once every two decades in his family. Thinking it would be decent material for our blog, we all arrived for the ritual. Unfortunately we then experienced the most horrific ancient curse there.

For the French-American friendship week, Marinette and her class travel to New York, the city of superheroes! The perfect opportunity for Marinette to spend time with her friends, especially Adrien. In fact, he's travelling with his father, Gabriel Agreste, who is particularly interested in a unique exhibition of a precious necklace holding an eagle talon... a jewel that could possess powers that Hawk Moth wants. Ladybug and Cat Noir will soon have to ally with the American heroes to defend them from their enemy!â€”farhanazhari05

To help her see the error of her ways, Giovanni decides to take matters into his own hands, only to lock horns with the young Casanova's unconventional, hard-working, no-nonsense mother, Monica. Now, as two worlds collide, unexpected things start to happen in the name of love. Will things work out in the end?â€”Nick Riganas

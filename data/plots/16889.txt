Having just beaten the jocks of the Alpha Beta fraternity at their own game in Revenge of the Nerds (1984), the underdogs from Lambda Lambda Lambda have now become the heroes of the campus. However, while on their way to sunny Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to attend the national fraternity convention as the representatives of Adams College, a well-orchestrated conspiracy will trap Lewis, Booger, and the rest of the boys in a deserted island, far away from civilization. Now, with the very future of their fraternity hanging by a thread, the Tri-Lambs must put to good use their exceptional talents, and thwart, once more, the plans of the despicable Alphas. Is revenge sweeter the second time around?â€”Nick Riganas

Over the course of the film, Peck is tasked to deliver a baby crocodile, a baby ram, and a baby porcupine.Each time, Peck returns a little more worse for wear. When he returns to find that Gus is planning to have him deliver a baby shark, Peck flies off to another cloud person. Gus grows angry, and then upset that his friend has abandoned him.Soon after, Peck returns and gives the reason why he left: the other cloud person had helped fashion some protective gear for the plucky stork to continue to assist his friend. Gus is overjoyed that Peck has returned, and produces Peck's next delivery: a baby electric eel.

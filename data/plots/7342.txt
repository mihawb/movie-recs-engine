Based on Stephen King's classic, 'Carrie' tells the story of a teenage girl with telekinetic abilities. But Carrie White does not have a happy life; she's an isolated, lonely girl who is either ignored or harassed by her classmates at school; she has no social life; and is excluded from the rest of the world by her ultra-fundamentalist, fanatical Christian mother at home. With graduation just around the corner, Carrie suffers a humiliating incident at school; she has her first period in the shower, and because her demented mother has kept these things a secret, she thinks she is bleeding to death. Her classmates start taunting her in the shower until the teacher puts a stop to it, but the harassment does not end there. The girls, led by Chris Hargensen fill her locker up with tampons and write a nasty message on the door. Carrie's teachers stick up for her & the girls are sentenced to a week's detention in the gym. When Chris skips detention, she is suspended and expelled from the upcoming prom. But Chris & her boyfriend, Billy Nolan, devise a nasty plan to humiliate Carrie when they discover Tommy Ross - one of the school's football players - is taking Carrie to the prom. Through some help from one of her friends, Chris manages to have the election results for King and Queen rigged, to get Carrie & Tommy up on stage. Carrie has finally got her moment in the sun - only to have it come crashing down around her when Chris and Billy drop a vat of blood on Carrie's head. Chris's friends again start to taunt Carrie with mocking laughter. Then, the doors slam shut, fire breaks out - and only a few people will survive...

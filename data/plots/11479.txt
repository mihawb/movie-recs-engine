The Parisian broker Stephan only needs the signature from his wife Patricia for their divorce - but she left 13 years ago for living with Amazonas Indians. Stephan finds her in the village and gets stuck for two days, where he learns that he has got a son, who grew up as an Indian. Meanwhile he fails to confirm a soy bean transaction and promises his son Mimi-Siku to show him Paris as soon as he will become a man. However, this happens next day when the tribe celebrates the children's festival. So both fly back to Paris, where Stephan and his partner Richard try to limit their losses by selling the beans to the Russian mafia, and Mimi-Siku discovers the city with bare feet. He climbs the Eiffel tower and prefers to hunt doves with bow-and-arrow instead of eating cornflakes. Stephan moves his son to the family of his partner, where Mimi-Siku falls actively in love with Richard's daughter Sophie. Discovered, Sophie is set to be sent into a boarding school, and therefore rescued by Mimi-Siku, while the mafia has discovered the dropped bean price and is threatening and claiming their money back. Both operations are entangled, and finally they get the money, and Mimi-Siku is sent back to the tribe. But, of course, this is not the end ..â€”Tom Pfeifer <pfeifer@fokus.gmd.de>

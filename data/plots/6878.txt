The adventure begins when the loving owners of three irresistible pets (Chance, a fun-loving American bulldog pup; Sassy, a hilarious Himalayan cat who lives up to her name; and Shadow, a wise old golden retriever) are forced to leave them in the temporary care of a friend who lives hundreds of miles away. But after several days, they think their owners must be in trouble, so they decide to head for home. On their incredible journey across the ruggedly beautiful Sierras, they encounter unexpected surprises from man, beast, and nature alike.â€”Robert Lynch <docrlynch@yahoo.com>

On a cold Christmas Eve, Private, Central Park Zoo's youngest penguin and the waddle's most compassionate member, summons up all his courage to sneak out in Manhattan's festive bustling streets in search of a little something for Ted, the solitary polar bear. However, the densely-populated city is definitely not a place for a small creature--and before long--Private will find himself in a real predicament, as Rico, Skipper, and Kowalski try their best to rescue the helpless companion from a true Yuletide tragedy. But, will they make it in time?â€”Nick Riganas

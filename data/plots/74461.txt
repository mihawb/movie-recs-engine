In a valiant but pointless attempt to cheer up their freshly dumped friend and former Dungeons and Dragons legend Joe, two enthusiastic Live Action Role Players--Eric, a 27-level Grand Sorcerer in the making, and Hung, a medieval Master Rogue--drag their sad companion to a large-scale LARP campaign in the middle of a forest. Soon, though, things will spiral out of control when a cryptic dark incantation from the pages of an innocent prop book of spells accidentally summons a demonic succubus bent on wreaking havoc. Now, let them try to stop a murderous extra-dimensional being with several foam sticks and a handful of plastic swords.â€”Nick Riganas

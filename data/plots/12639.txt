Chico, one of the remaining members of The Magnificent Seven, has set down roots in the village that they had defended in the first film. One day, the village is raided by fifty gunmen under the employ of rancher Lorca. Lorca's bandits abduct all of the village's men to be used as slave labor, leaving the women and children behind. Chris, the former leader of the Seven, is sought out by Chico's wife Petra for help, and thus assembles a new Seven to come to the village's rescue once again.â€”rcs0411@yahoo.com

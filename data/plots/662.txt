It's post-WWIII Paris, where nuclear radiation has devastated life on the surface, driving most survivors underground. There are generally two categories of survivors, the victors who control what happens and the prisoners who are at the mercy of the victors. Because of the devastation, scientists have been experimenting with time travel so that they can learn from both the past and the future to help cure the present. They generally use prisoners as guinea pigs because of the physical and emotional toll of the experiments. One specific prisoner they choose because he has such a strong emotional attachment to one specific memory from his past, which they believe will make it easier for him to endure the travel if they send him back to that specific time. That time is at Orly Airport when he was a child before the war, seeing a woman off in the distance on the outdoor viewing platform. This fond memory is despite him realizing that a man died at that time, that knowledge which is only deep in his subconscious. On his trips between the present and this specific time in his past, he, as an adult, is able to develop a relationship with this woman. Can it be sustained through the time travel, and/or do the scientists have a grander plan for him related to this strong memory?â€”Huggo

London, 2009. Both elderly, widowed and thus lonely, Roy Courtnay and Betty McLeish start dating after meeting on an online dating site, they each managing to get over the little white profile lies they eventually learn of the other as they know those lies are part of the process especially as they are each guilty of promulgating such themselves. What Betty is unaware of however in cherishing Roy as a companion she so desperately needs is that Roy is a high stakes con artist, who, at least according to his regular partner in crime Vincent, does it as much for the thrill as for the money. He is also not averse to using violence, including kill, to maintain his cover. While the stakes of his cons are high, Roy has to continue to do it to survive as he usually has to share those high stakes among several accomplices. Eventually, Roy begins to believe that he's hit the jackpot in Betty in learning that her net worth is close to £3 million, of which he would only have to share a small portion with Vincent. In gaining Betty's confidence, Roy believes he has one thing going against him and one thing going for him. The former is Betty's suspicious grandson, graduate student Stephen, who is writing his dissertation on Albert Speer and who seems to be looking out for his grandmother in not trusting Roy on any little thing. And the latter is learning that Betty has health issues, which will take her earlier from the world than later. The one thing that Roy does not know which may throw a wrench into his plans with Betty is why he continually sees the same vehicle driving by her house, the occupant who seems specifically interested in their direction.—Huggo

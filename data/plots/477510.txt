On another side of the city, Tara is a coffee-shop server who passes her days talking with her shallow dog-walker friend Daisy. Tara, who is crazy about friendly but full-of-himself vet Dr. Mike, one day meets Garrett, the eccentric, shy owner of an animal-care center who is unable to tell Tara that he loves her. Grace and Kurt are a married couple made nervous by the arrival of their first adopted child Amelia; they note that she doesn't seem happy with her new home and her new parents.

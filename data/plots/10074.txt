Andy Samberg is Rod Kimble, a lovable loser who is, without a doubt, the worlds worst stuntman and probably the only one that performs on a Moped. He does have a group of loyal friends who serve as his crew and a possible romance with girl-next-door, Denise (Isla Fisher).When Rods hated step-fathers life is dependant on an expensive transplant, Rod wants to perform the ultimate stunt to raise the money to save his life, just so he can have yet another chance (for he has already had many) to beat his step-father (Ian McShane) in a fight and earn his respect. So, with the help of his crew, the love of his life, and many other people among the way. Rod sets out to jump more buses than Evil Knievel!

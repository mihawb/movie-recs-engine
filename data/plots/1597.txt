Male nurse Greg Focker is poised to propose to his girlfriend Pam during a weekend stay at her parents' home. But here's the catch . . . he needs to ask her father first. Alas, the fur flies as Jack Byrnes, Pam's cat-crazy, ex-CIA father takes an immediate dislike to her less-than-truthful beau. Greg's quest for approval gets seriously sidetracked as Murphy's Law takes over and a string of mishaps turns him into a master of disaster and total pariah in the eyes of the entire family . . . all except for his shell-shocked girlfriend, who can't believe she still loves her one-man wrecking crew.â€”Official DVD cover

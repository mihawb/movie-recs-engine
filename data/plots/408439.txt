John and Evelyn White are a pair of serial killers who target teenage girls. One night, Vicki Maloney, who impetuously sneaks out of the house for a forbidden party, is lured by the pair into their clutches. Now paying dearly for her naivety, Vicki must endure a horrific nightmare of confinement and torture at the hands of this depraved pair. Against these murderers, Vicki's only chance of survival is a mix of subterfuge, cunning, and mind games while her estranged parents and her boyfriend desperately try to learn what has happened and what can be done to find her. Meanwhile, the Whites have growing problems of their own, which could provide the only hope Vicki could have to survive.â€”Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)

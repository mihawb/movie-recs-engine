This is a comedy that references a heck of a lot of other movies and seeks to parody them in the most ridiculous and hilariously over the top way.Nick Rivers (Val Kilmer) is an archetypal '50's rock 'n roll heart throb: young, dumb and full of fun. He's Elvis Presley), The Beach Boys, The Big Bopper, Buddy Holly and any other rocker from that period you can think of.He is invited to East Germany to be featured in the musical festival there and is unaware that evil "Nazi's" are only using the festival as a cover to disguise their true dream of world domination. They plan to use this festival to distract the NATO nations away from their true goals.Nick gets involved with a pretty, young woman; Hillary (Lucy Gutteridge). She is in fact part of the French Resistance (in East Germany) and part of a very oddly and obviously named crew of French freedom fighters, including Chocolate Mousse (Eddie Tagoe), Deja Vu (Jim Carter) and many others.He gets into a heap of trouble, lands in jail and then attempts an escape in a very slapstick sort of way. He is eventually released to perform at the festival.Will Nick's heart be broken by Hilary when her ex, Nigel (Christopher Villiers), who she spent time with on an island as a child and then felt stricken when he vanished, comes back into her life, still sporting an oiled six-pack and a loin cloth?And will he decide to help the resistance with a couple of tunes and gyrations of his pelvis? Will he save the day in a manner that is completely side splitting? Will he win the love of Hillary and still sing Tuttie Fruttie?

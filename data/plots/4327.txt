Charles "Charlie" Townsend's (John Forsythe's) private investigation company is addressed by programmer Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell), owner of Knox Technologies, whose revolutionary voice-recognition software has been stolen. Charlie's Angels Natalie (Cameron Diaz), Dylan (Drew Barrymore), and Alex (Lucy Liu) are sent to place a bug in the system of bitter rival Roger Corwin (Tim Curry), who is under strong suspicion. But after the deed is done, the Angels and their boss Bosley (Bill Murray) face the fact of a destroyed home base, as well as Charlie's life in immediate danger. But how do you protect someone you never met?â€”Julian Reischl <julianreischl@mac.com>

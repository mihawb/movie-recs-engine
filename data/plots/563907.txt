Rome, present day. The movie starts with 3 guys in their 40s who try to raise some money acting as tourist guides (unofficial...) for people who are or could be interested into visiting the places where an ancient criminal band named "Banda della Magliana" acted, back in the 80s, handling underwater/illegal betting and such.
Suddenly, via a strange Einstein-Rosen bridge, they are taken to year 1982! It's July and Football World Championship is on everyone's mouth: so, after a bit of initial (but not that much) astonishment, the 3 guys try to turn the events to their own advantage - exploiting their knowledge of the future events (namely, football scores).
But they get involved into the real bad guys from the Banda, really powerful at the times. So, they first risk losing one of them which is held captive because they can't pay an expensive bill in a night club... but somehow are able to gather the needed money and he's set free. But... then he makes the foolish mistake of announcing the soon-to-come scorer of next match... and hence the Bad-guys Boss hires him as his own fortune teller!
Things get somewhat complicated as one of the guys is killed in jealousy hit, the Boss's woman falls in love with one of the guys from the future, and they all are forced into cooperating in a bank robbery... which does not go very well but somehow the three do survive and manage to get back to the Time Portal, not before rescuing the Band Treasure (whose hiding place they know from the future books and trials reports) and placing it in a "safe" place that they will be able to collect in present time.
So they get back to the future and see some changes in their lives, for the best.

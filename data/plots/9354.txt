Wayne Szalinski is a crazy scientist who invents a shrinking machine that is so powerful it only blows things up. When a baseball is hit through the window and lands in the path of its laser, it begins working. Wayne's two kids plus the boys next door end up getting shrunk. He accidentally sweeps them up and puts them out with the trash, so they have to travel through the thick grass back to the house, while braving giant bugs, a sprinkler, and a lawnmower.â€”Jason Ihle <jrihl@conncoll.edu>

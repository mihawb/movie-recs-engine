Heidi is an eight-year-old Swiss orphan whose aunt hands her off to her mountain-dwelling grandfather, then returns and takes her to live in the wealthy Sesemann household in Frankfurt, Germany as a companion to Klara, a sheltered girl in a wheelchair. Heidi is unhappy but makes the best of the situation, always longing for her grandfather.

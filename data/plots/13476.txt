Rosalee Futch (Kate Bosworth), a Piggly Wiggly supermarket checkout girl in a small West Virginia town, wins a contest for a date with Tad Hamilton (Josh Duhamel), a Hollywood movie star. Tad's agents came up with this contest to change Tad's bad-boy image and help his career in getting another big movie part. A date with the sweet and innocent Rosalee is just the ticket that Tad needs, when he falls in love with her. Tad moves to the small town so he can be near Rosalee, and this drives Tad's agents crazy. Rosalee's best friend, Pete (Topher Grace) finally tells Rosalee that he has loved her his whole life. Rosalee must choose between her lifetime friend Pete or Tad, the rich and famous movie star. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)

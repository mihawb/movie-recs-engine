Six friends get together during lockdown for their weekly zoom call. It's Haley's turn to organise an activity and instead of a quiz, she's arranged for a Medium to conduct a s√©ance. Bored and feeling mischievous, Jemma decides to have some fun and invents a story about a boy in her school who hanged himself. However, her prank gives license for a demonic presence to cross over, taking on the guise of the boy in Jemma's made-up story. The friends begin noticing strange occurrences in their homes as the evil presence begins to make itself known, and they soon realise that they might not survive the night.

A family by surprise! Five people who never met are convened by a notary for the reading of a will, and learn they are all brothers and sisters, children of the same father! They'll share a large inheritance if they can deliver the ashes to their father's favorite lake in Arizona! Accepting the challenge, these newfound family members ("mai stati uniti") set out on a journey full of hijinx and comic adventures in the Stati Uniti d'America. What a quintet! Antonio, the gambling addicted waiter; Angela, the panicky divorcee; Nino, an unemployed mechanic; Carmen, a shopaholic; and Michele, who grew up at a zoo.â€”r-potenza

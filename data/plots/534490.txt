Cain Burgess was in prison for someone else's crimes and for seven years he dreamed of freedom. Every day he thought that he would someday be released, and would take revenge on his offenders. The hero of the film "Avengement" every year became stronger and tempered his iron will in the dark prison walls. One day, he manages to neutralize the two guards, and escape from custody. Once free, Cain hurries into the lair of the criminal community to pay off all who have destroyed his future.â€”Peter-Patrick76 (peter-patrick@mail.com)

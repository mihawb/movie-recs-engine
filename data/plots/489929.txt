Two talkative and bitter people, Frank and Lindsay, meet on the way to the same destination wedding. Frank is scarred from a bad family history, and Lindsay is heartbroken from a previous relationship. At first, they do not get along. However, isolated from the other wedding guests, the two spend a lot of time together. Despite their verbal sparring, they eventually form a connection and have to decide whether or not to stay with each other after their trip is over.â€”Patrick Lin

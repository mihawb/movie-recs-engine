A spooky tale with a ghostly twist, a gritty, raw low budget psychological drama; Cathy Reed has been institutionalized most of her life due to Schizophrenia. Believing her possessed, her parents arranged an exorcism. Decades later Cathy is living independently and trying to leave the past in the past...not so easy when reminders seem to be everywhere and all is not as it first appears.â€”Haqi Ali

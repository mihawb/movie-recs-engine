This movie was the greatest sleeper movie since Boondock Saints. I saw the original to kill time, I have wasted an hour and a half in worse ways, and never thought a sequel would be made. HOLY SHIT THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME. High production value, plot moved very well, memorable lines, Nazis, a tank, gore, body counts, battles,it just goes on.It was better than Fury. Not going to write a thing about what happened so I don't spoil a second of it. Honestly, I would sell a kidney help make DEAD SNOW 3:White dead.Must see.

Three years after the unexpected love story in Like a Cat on a Highway (2017), sadly, tough Monica finds herself imprisoned for a crime she didn't commit. Now, with Alessio waiting tables at a pub in London and Agnese studying in England, the only person who can get Monica off the hook is Giovanni, who can only offer an alternative sentence: to get her out of prison, Monica must do community service in the parish of San Basilio. But there, temptation awaits in the shape of the pious and equally handsome priest, Don Davide. Will jealous Giovanni take this situation lying down? Above all, are Monica and Giovanni destined to be together?â€”Nick Riganas

He then offers Meghan tips on how to connect with a more diverse audience, saying she needs to present herself to other demographics equally, and that she looks too stiff. They let her use Scrilla's phone to call for help, but she only remembers three numbers - hers, her parents' and Kyle's. She sends a text to her own phone, and then calls Kyle for help.

She also takes the time to call out Kyle for being a terrible boyfriend (he is watching and is arrested by cops since his number was traced off the drug dealer's phone), and then gives a shout-out to Rose and Denise for being great friends, as well as Scrilla, Hulk, and Pookie (they cheer when they see this).

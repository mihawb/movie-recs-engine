At the hospital, a doctor gives Donnelly the bad news: his wife of many years has died. He visits her body, placing a photograph of their pet rabbit in her hands. In the early-morning light, he catches a train back home to Dublin. He sits across from a talkative young man who seems to have a screw loose, making coarse observations and starting an argument with a couple in the next seats who are clearly tense with each other. Over the next few miles, Donnelly learns that all four of them have lost someone that night, and the young man gives Donnelly a gift that might ease his pain. There's a strange bond in grief.â€”<jhailey@hotmail.com>

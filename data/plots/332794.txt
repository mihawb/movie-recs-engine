In 1949, the eccentric naval officer who wanted to be a pilot, Jacques-Yves Cousteau, quits the Navy to explore and document the undiscovered blue world that surrounds us. With the iconic Calypso--the 1941 minesweeper--and his hand-picked crew, Cousteau's aquatic adventure covers roughly thirty years of an inarguably rich in achievements life: from the invention of the autonomous regulator to his romantic views of colonising the sea. However, although he was a highly influential and fearlessly ambitious man, the French pioneer was also a mortal--an imperfect human being blemished by his disloyalty to his caring wife, Simone, and the constant conflicts with his younger son, Philippe. But, above all, Cousteau was the man who brought the hidden wonders of the sea into our living rooms, and the one who raised awareness of the imperative need to protect the nature--a never-ending effort that kept on long after Philippe's sudden death, on 28 June 1979.â€”Nick Riganas

Metal music, paint, and family are the passions of struggling painter, Jesse, who lives a happy life with his wife, and daughter. Things look brighter when Jesse finds a huge old house, in rural Texas, selling at a very low price, due to its mysterious past. They move in and Jesse converts the barn into a studio. But soon, his work starts taking on a new, darker flavour - and things get even more ominous when the hulking, unbalanced son of the former owners appears on the doorstep. Jesse's family won't be safe until they find a way to quiet the Devil himself.â€”subratjain1

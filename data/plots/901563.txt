With summer drawing to a close, inseparable 13-year-old best friends Léo and Rémi idle away the rest of the holidays before school. It is as if the two bosom buddies share an unbreakable brotherly bond beyond their comprehension--in fact, nothing can ever come between them. However, when the boys' cloudless friendship catches the attention of their schoolmates on the first day of school, mean remarks put Léo and Rémi's close relationship to the test. After that, nothing will ever be the same again.—Nick Riganas

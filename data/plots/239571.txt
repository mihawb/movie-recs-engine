After miraculously surviving an explosion and saving two co-workers on an oil rig, Dawson Cole is reunited as co-heir by his benefactor's last will with his true first love, Amanda Collier, and they reminisce in a flash-back structure. Dawson left home due to one dose too many gross verbal and physical abuse by his father Tommy Cole, who hates him being a good boy and model student, unlike his no-good brothers. Ran away without options, Dawson shelters for the rain in the barn of grumpy old widower Tuck, a veteran, who gradually adopts him in all but name and even wards off the Cole thugs by shotgun. Thus he's able to date properly with spoiled rich girl Amanda, who has to seduces the shy hunk but keeps prodding him to aspire a future. That path goes through college, which he can hardly afford, yet he refuse father Collier's offer to pay his way to keep away from her. Just when everything seems settled, Tommy returns to revenge his wrecked car by beating up Tuck. Amanda deputizes her gentle brother Bobby to prevent vindictive Dawson ending up in jail, but in the struggle of the Coles Bobby is accidentally killed. Jailed, Dawson breaks off contact with Alanda, who marries a careerist and devotes herself to fine son Jared, about to go to college. Their love is rekindled after spreading Tuck's ashes, but they decide not to break up her family, however unhappy the marriage. A year later, tragedy strikes in the form of another Cole revenge after Dawson rescues Bobby's son Aaron from Tommy's clutches, with a providential consolation for Amanda and a deserving innocent in dire need.â€”KGF Vissers

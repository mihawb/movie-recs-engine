Louise lives on a farm in Provence and, since the death of her husband, has been taking care of the pear orchard on her own. As idyllic as life in the country seems, it is threatening to overwhelm her: The bank wants the loan back and her customers doubt her competence. At the same time, Louise is trying to keep her pubescent daughter Emma and younger son FÃ©lix under control. And then, on her way home from the market, she hits a stranger in front of her house. The stranger seems to be fine, but she invites him into the house to treat him anyway. Louise lets Pierre, the name of the injured man, sleep on the sofa. The next morning, the house is perfectly tidy. Pierre is not only neat, but somehow different. He is bluntly honest in everything he says, and he is a maverick who loves to quote prime numbers and see them in different colors. The sensitive man, who suffers from Asperger's syndrome, blossoms in Louise's presence. He helps her, more poorly than not, sell her delicious pear tarts at the market and soon feels he has found something he didn't think he was missing: a home. Louise actually tries to keep him out of her life, too afraid that her heart will be broken again. But Pierre is not so easy to shake off.

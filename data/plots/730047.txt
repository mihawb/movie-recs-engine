Nursing a silent, long-unrequited adoration for his beloved Roxanne, sadly, Cyrano de Bergerac, a chivalrous swordsman and tortured poet, dares not voice his fervent feelings for her. But Cyrano is a lion on the battlefield; so, how can he feel incapable of expressing his affection? As one thing leads to another, and beautiful Roxanne finds herself smitten with the handsome but inarticulate recruit Christian de Neuvillette, Cyrano must swallow his pride, swear to keep the secret to the grave and offer to ghostwrite ardent love letters for his charming opponent. However, cruel, unexpressed love has never stopped growing in the duellist's sad heart. Can Cyrano summon up the courage to confess his profound feelings? How much longer must he endure the pain of longing?â€”Nick Riganas

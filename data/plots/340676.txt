Maureen Cartwright works as a personal fashion shopper for an egotistical celebrity named Kyra. It is a job she dislikes for a boss she dislikes, who she rarely sees, but it is a job which allows Maureen to stay in Paris, where she feels she needs to be at least in the short term. Maureen's twin brother, Lewis, recently died from a heart attack. Maureen suffers from the same genetic heart defect that led to Lewis' death, it is a condition which is manageable in that it need not be a death sentence. Maureen and Lewis are/were also mediums, they not only having a spiritual connection to each other, but to the spirit world, although Maureen admits that she more often followed Lewis who was more attuned to his abilities. They made a pact that whoever died first would send a sign to the other about the afterlife. Lewis' partner, Lara, wants to sell her and Lewis' Paris house to couple friends of theirs, they who want some indication before they buy that Lewis is all right with them moving in and/or that he is not haunting the house. In doing Lewis and Lara's friends and Lara the favor of spending a night in the house for this purpose, Maureen hopes that Lewis may send her that sign. As Maureen continues on with her life, she begins to experience things that she is uncertain are real which could/would mean that someone sinister is toying with her, coded signs from Lewis, something else and/or a combination of the above, the actual source of what she is experiencing which would dictate how she should react.â€”Huggo

Based on a true story, Black Water is a thriller thats sounds a now familiar warning that Australia can be dangerous place for a holiday.Its DNA goes back to the taut, tight thrills of Spielberg s Duel, then traces a line through the classics of Jaws and Alien, past the guerrilla film making of Robert Rodriguez and mutates into the same gene pool as quasi-real horrorsurvival such as the Blair Witch Project and Open Water Black Water is based in realism. It stalks the line between horror and psychological thriller, a tale or true survival, that begs the question what would you do? How would you get out alive?

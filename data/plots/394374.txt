Joaquín is a wheelchair-bound computer engineer threatened with the imminent foreclosure of her house because he's in debt to his bank. Trying to save it, he rents one room to exotic dancer Berta and her 6-year-old daughter Betty. Meanwhile, Joaquín is blocked emotionally by memories of his wife and daughter who died in an accident years ago. Berta lives with the drama of Betty, who mysteriously stopped talking two years ago. Their initial uneasy coexistence gradually eases, then turns into friendship and then love between them, before Joaquín accidentally discovers that a little gang wants to rob a bank, and he decides to secretly watch them, but his plan crashes against a couple of secrets that will threaten all the plan provided.—Chockys

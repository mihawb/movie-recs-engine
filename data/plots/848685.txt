With big plans to farm the land and sell vegetables at the local market for a living, former teacher Antoine and his supportive wife Olga have left their comfortable life in France behind to seek a fresh start in a remote rural part of Galicia. Instead, the dream turned sour--resentment, xenophobia, and a corrosive undercurrent of unrelenting animosity awaited the grizzled French couple. Because, like it or not, when your immediate neighbours plan an all-out war, there is no turning back. And as tensions simmer and the inflamed row escalates into a full-blown vendetta, the inevitable clash between the newcomers and the locals can only end in a shocking outbreak of violence that changes everything.â€”Nick Riganas

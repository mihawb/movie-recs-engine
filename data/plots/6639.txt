A chronicle which takes in the fifty-year period straddling the 19th and 20th centuries. We are privy to the feelings of the central character, Fiorentino Ariza. He cannot help staring at the lovely but shy Fermina Daza The film is framed by the accidental death from a fall out of a mango tree by the 80-year-old Dr. Juvenal Urbino (Benjamin Bratt), married for a half century to the 72-year-old Fermina Daza. Visited on the day of the funeral by Florentino Ariza, she is enraged at the gall of a man who professes his lifetime love for her, at which point the film flashes back to the early courtship and proceeds through some fifty-two years of their lives.

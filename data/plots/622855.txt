In the gloriously-vibrant town of Cobbleton, legendary toymaker Jeronicus Jangle's (Forest Whitaker) fanciful inventions burst with whimsy and wonder. But when his trusted apprentice (Keegan-Michael Key) steals his most prized creation, it's up to his equally-bright and inventive granddaughter (Madalen Mills)--and a long-forgotten invention--to heal old wounds and reawaken the magic within.â€”Netflix

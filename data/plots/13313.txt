Belle (Paige O'Hara) prepares the castle for Christmas against Beast's (Robbie Benson's) wishes, trying to bring him happiness for the season. Forte (Tim Curry), a pipe organ, fears that Belle's plans may eventually bring about an end to the curse - the curse that brought him more importance in the Master's life. Forte uses Fife (Paul Reubens), a flute who desperately wants a solo, to destroy Belle's plans and get rid of her.â€”R. John Berggren <jberg@nina.pagesz.net>

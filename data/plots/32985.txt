Once a mercenary of Queen Elizabeth I fighting Ottomans in Africa, Solomon met the Devil's Reaper and discovered he was bound for Hell. Barely escaping, he soon renounced violence to atone for his past sins, seeking out redemption in a life of peace. That is until the followers of the sorcerer Malachi kidnap a Puritan girl, Meredith Crowthorn, and brutally slaughter her family before his eyes, forcing Solomon to take up arms and return to his violent ways once more to rescue her.â€”corsos, corrected by Pike84

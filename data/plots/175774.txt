Gwendolyn Shepherd is a regular 16-year-old girl annoyed that her family definitely has too many secrets, all having to do with the time-travel gene that's passed down through their family. Everyone is certain that Gwen's cousin Charlotte has the gene, so everything is all about Charlotte, all the time. Until the day Gwen, out of the clear blue sky, suddenly finds herself in London at the end of the 19th century. She knows right away that she, and not Charlotte, was born to be a time traveler--even if she could do without it, just as she could do without Charlotte's arrogant boyfriend Gideon de Villiers, with whom she now must forge an alliance in order to clear up the biggest secret of her family history. One thing is clear: she will do everything possible to solve the ancient mysteries. What isn't clear is that one should not fall in love between the times: that would REALLY complicate things.â€”Concorde Filmverleih / TM International

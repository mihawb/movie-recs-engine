Everything in Djibi's life revolves around his beloved seven-year-old daughter Sofia. This devoted single father never misses their cherished rite of bedtime stories. Every night as Sofia falls asleep, her father takes her into "Storyland", a fantasy film studio where their extraordinary fairy-tale adventures come to life starring Djibi in the lead role as the heroic Prince Charming. Five years later, pre-adolescent Sofia starts to grow out of her father's stories and makes up her own tales with Djibi no longer the heroic lead. As his roles in both the real world and in "Storyland" begin to change, Djibi must find a way to remain eternally the hero of his daughter's life, imagination, and stories.

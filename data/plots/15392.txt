Eugene Martone, the "Lightning Boy", is a lover of blues. He studies guitar at Julliard, but he is looking for the 30th unknown song of Roberto Johnson. One day, he meets Willie Brown, the "Blind Dog," in an old-folks' home and is convinced that he possess the lost song. Eugene helps Willie to escape the asylum and goes with him to Mississippi. They can just afford a bus ticket from New York to halfway to Mississippi, so they must hitchhike the rest of the way, and doing so they meet Frances, a girl who left home and wishes to be a dancer in Los Angeles. The trio passes through many strange adventures and situations together, and the climax is the guitar duel between Eugene and Jack Butler.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

Looking forward to spending time with the loving Grandma Roberts, Barbie and her sisters, Stacie, Skipper, and Chelsea, set out on an exciting trip to their picturesque hometown of Willows. There, a beautiful surprise awaits the girls, as their grandmother's dog, Tiffany, has given birth to four adorable puppies; their new best friends. Against the backdrop of the annual Willow Fest, Barbie, her sisters, and the puppies will embark on a fascinating adventure, when they accidentally discover a worn-out treasure map in grandma's dusty attic. Now, all that the girls need to do is to follow the clues, and, hopefully, unearth the long-forgotten prize. What could it be?â€”Nick Riganas

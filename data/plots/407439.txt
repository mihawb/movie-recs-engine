Judea, 33 AD. Mary is a faithful young girl from the village of Magdala near the sea of Galilea. Reluctant to follow the traditions and destiny reserved to women, living only as wife and mother; she wishes to be free. After she rejects the marriage proposal of family friend, Ephraim, her brother Daniel and father Elisha, believing she is possessed by a demon, arrange an exorcism. Elisha consults Jesus, a healer who is earning fame among the local Jewish people with his speeches about a kingdom of peace and love, free of hate, tyranny, oppression, and persecution. Jesus comes to see Mary and shares his gospel. Astonished by Jesus'words, charisma, and personality, Mary decides to follow him despite her family's strong opposition. She meets several men who also walk with Jesus: Peter, Andrew, James, John, and Judas, who have their personal interests and ideas about Jesus' words and his revolution. At the same time that Mary feels more passionate about Jesus and his vision of the world and people, Peter develops a progressive resentment of her, believing that her presence among them weakens Jesus and his message; Peter notices that Jesus pays more and more attention to her. When they arrive at Jerusalem, Jesus and his apostles try to transmit the message against Roman Empire and Jews' authorities, but the events soon turn dramatically against Jesus, and the confrontation between Mary and Peter about Jesus not only changes them both but will change the whole world.â€”Chockys

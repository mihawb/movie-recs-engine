In ancient Egypt, the mighty warlord, Nebserek, steals the fabled Fang of Anubis--a cursed sword imbued with the power of hell and the strength of its countless victims--intent on creating his evil empire. As the ruthless monarch burns down to the ground a small village, the wounded Akkadian mercenary, Mathayus, joins forces with the Nubian princess, Tala, to embark on a long and dangerous quest to find the mystical Book of Souls: the only thing that can put an end to Nebserek's tyranny. Will the legendary Scorpion King bring hope and restore peace?â€”Nick Riganas

This is set in the not too distant future. Convicted criminals are used as Guinea pigs in the hope that they can get their sentences shortened, by volunteering to take new synthetic drugs that a pharmaceutical company manufactures. This film focuses on pills that are given to such criminals, to make them feel many emotions, but mostly "Love". One particular patient struggles with these feelings and starts to question if it's all in his head. And so he starts on a path to get to the truth.

A grouchy couple named Harry and Zinnia Wormwood are parents to a very sweet 6-year-old daughter named Matilda. Unlike them and her bratty brother, Michael, she becomes a very sweet and extremely intelligent girl who can't wait to go to school and read books. After a while, Harry and Zinnia send her to the school with the worst headmistress in the world, a very sweet teacher, and good friends. While trying to put up with her parents' and headmistress' cruelty, she starts to unwittingly unleash telekinetic powers, destroying a television and making a newt fly onto the headmistress. With enough practice, she learns to control her telekinetic powers and is soon using them on the headmistress so she can drive her away from the school.â€”anonomys

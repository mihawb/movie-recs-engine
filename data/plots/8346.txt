The movie opens with 30 year old Toula (Nina Vardalos) being picked up by her father in a rain storm. She flashes back to being different and not fitting in at school as a little girl, because she was (staunchly) Greek and nerdy. Her father wants her to get married and says she is getting so old. Not listening and unhappy waiting tables at her family's restaurant, she meets a new man. It goes no where at first, but she breaks away and convinces her parents to let her run her Aunt's travel agency, while she attends computer school. Toula feels like a caged animal set free, and of course, the new man, Ian Miller (John Corbett) stops by after seeing Toula through the window. The two start dating and dad finds out.

Soon, Ian asks her to marry him and the family must accept it! So Gus has Ian convert and Ian's parents go to Toula's parents to meet the family. Of course they have all of the cousin's and other relatives over, loud Greek music and a lamb on a spit in the front yard. Toula's parents and aunt are totally over bearing and scare Ian's parents. Toula's brother and cousin won't stop having Ian speak to the family in Greek, while disguising curse words as greetings. But the wedding is on, and it is big and loud. Gus gives a toast and found that Miller comes from Milo which means apple in Greek. yes, Toula's last name means orange and the joke goes over well.

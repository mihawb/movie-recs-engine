When Bond seems to be evading questions M grounds him from duty, as he leaves he encounters Max Denbigh/C, the new Director-General of Joint Intelligence Service, a global surveillance network which aims to launch its own spy program "Nine Eyes".Bond leaves the building and Moneypenny approaches him with personal effects from Skyfall, Bond asks for them to be brought to his place personally at 9pm.

The funeral occurs in three days in Rome, Bond asks Moneypenny to research the name "The Pale King" while he goes to Rome quietly. Bond looks through the effects and finds his adoption certificate and a photograph of him with his foster father, another boy is in the photo but his side of the photo has been burned. The next day, as Tanner takes Bond to Q's lab by the river, he informs Bond about the impending demolition of the old MI6 building after the bombing by Silva; a sleek glass building across the river was erected as the replacement for the British Intelligence. C is pushing for greater surveillance, purely digitized as he deems human agents obsolete and slow. Recent terror attacks in Hamburg and Tunisia are pushing government opinion in C's favor and the initiation of the Nine Eyes program will allow preemptive security against global terrorism.In Q's lab Bond is injected with a nanochip code-named "Smart Blood" to track him as a precaution after his actions in Mexico, Q also provides Bond a watch fitted with an explosive. Bond asks Q to help him disappear, which Q is loathe to do, however he does disclose that the Smart Blood is experimental and they will experience signal loss two days after transmission for a twenty-four hour interval.

Bond heads to a syndicate meeting gaining admittance with Marco's ring, various terrorists and criminals from all over the world are discussing their progress, with shares in human and drug trafficking, furthermore, the Nine Eyes program is their idea to counteract investigations against them and C is one of their number with the terror attacks to convince the world to permit Nine Eyes. The silhouetted leader appears whom everyone fears and respects, a number is asked to assassinate the Pale King, one loyal member volunteers, another steps forward for the position, Mr Hinx, a silent and strong man.

He asks another name examined, Franz Oberhauser, long believed dead. Bond escapes Hinx with backwards firing flamethrowers to blind his view and launching from the car in an ejector seat as the vehicle steers into the Tiber. Moneypenny searches the name Oberhauser, all she finds is a twenty-year old newspaper article on a father and son presumed dead in an avalanche.In Tokyo C is pitching the Nine Eyes program to other countries, a vote is called, only the South African representatives refuse, the program is denied as it must be decided by unanimous vote, Tanner reads a news headline on the car chase in Rome which makes he and M worry that Bond has left without permission, M calls Q to confirm Bond's location, he is in Altuassee, Austria, Q has to lie that he's in Chelsea, London.Bond has traced Mr White to a remote cabin fitted with cameras where he is in hiding and terminally ill from thallium poisoning.

Bond can tell he's protecting someone, his daughter, he offers to protect her in exchange for the mastermind's location, Bond offers up his Walther as a sign of his word, White aims the gun at Bond and gives a name "L'Americain" along with his daughter's location, the Hoffler Clinic and shoots himself.In London C gives M a tour of the new intelligence building, M asks if C has ever had to kill another human, the latter doesn't respond and plays the recording of Bond and Moneypenny's phone call, M is worried over C watching MI6 agents. Mr Hinx finds White's cabin and discovers his corpse and a surveillance camera showing his final moments. Bond arrives at the clinic, Mr White's daughter is a psychiatric and fitness doctor, Dr Madeleine Swann. Swann reads through Bond's form to evaluate, the final question asking what his occupation is which is left blank, Bond confesses he's an assassin, Swann is fearful that he's there to kill her, he denies it along with killing her father, and that he made a promise to him, when he references L'Americain Swann throws him out. At the clinic bar Q approaches Bond, he insists that Bond return to England and that Franz Oberhauser is dead, Bond knows otherwise, he asks Q to analyze the ring, Q heads off to the Pevsner hotel while security sees Bond off the premises, he resists when he spots Hinx and his goons abduct Swann.They drive off in a convoy of jeeps and Bond chases them in a plane, more goons corner Q on a cable car and he escapes through a crowd.

In the middle of the night Bond wakes up and sees a mouse scurry into a hole in the wall, he finds a secret room behind it, inside is an assortment of contraband including a tracking console to locate Oberhauser's phone. A list of co-ordinates on the wall point to empty desert in North Africa.In London M hurries to Whitehall and learns that the South Africans have accepted Nine Eyes after the terror attack, the program launches in under 72 hours. C is elected head of the committee and the 00-program is terminated per the Home Secretary's orders. Bond and Swann take a train across desert to the supposed location of Oberhauser, back in London Moneypenny and Q show M satellite photos of a lair in the African desert which shows Bond is going, M says they cannot help him as C will spot it, Q is ordered to delete the Smart Blood data as safety, Bond must go it alone.Bond and Swann drink a toast on the train which is interrupted by a surprise attack from Hinx, he and Bond battle to the cargo car, Hinx nearly throws Bond out of the door, he's stopped when Swann shoots him in the arm with Bond's gun. Hinx attempts to strangle Swann, Bond wraps a rope around Hinx's neck with a hook at the other end attaching it a canister which Bond kicks off the train dragging Hinx out with it. Bond and Swann arrive at an abandoned station in the middle of the desert, after a lengthy wait a chauffeur driving a 1948 Rolls Royce Silver Wraith collects them and they are driven to Oberhauser's base in a crater. They are taken to separate rooms, in Bond's room is a framed photograph of him with his foster father Hannes and brother Franz, whom Bond recognized in Rome.

He demonstrates this on Bond who is restrained in a mechanical chair and drills bore into strategic places in his skull. Oberhauser explains that his father took Bond in after the loss of his parents and grew attached to him, Franz felt resentful, feeling that Bond was invading, comparing him to a cuckoo bird, when a cuckoo hatches in the nest of another bird it forces the other eggs out. Franz murdered his father and faked his own demise taking the name Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the surname taken from his mother's bloodline. Bond slips his watch loose and hands it to Swann and instructs her to arm the bomb and throw it across the room to Blofeld, and explosion releases Bond from captivity, he and Swann escape with Bond shooting most of the guards and triggering a gas explosion that destroys the entire lair.In London Bond summons M, Q, Moneypenny and Tanner to a secret location to inform them of C's Spectre association and the danger of Nine Eyes, they drive to C's intelligence center, Bond and M are in the front car which is driven off the road, Bond is taken hostage while M escapes and hops into the rear car.

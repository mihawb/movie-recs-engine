This movie picks up the Brady clan and plops them down in the 1990s with their original naivete intact. Their next-door neighbor, Larry Dittmeyer, is in charge of acquiring land for a new residential mini-mall, and they are the last holdouts on selling their land. Unbeknownst to them, he has also been receiving and concealing their mail, which includes overdue notices on property taxes. $20,000 is necessary to save their house from auction, and when their kids find out, they secretly go about raising money to save it.â€”Rick Gregory <rag.apa@email.apa.org>

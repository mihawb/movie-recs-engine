In the hope of finding true love, statuesque, raven-haired young witch Elaine settles into a classic Victorian home somewhere in a scenic small town in northern California. By stirring mysterious magic potions and using intricate ancient rituals, the single-minded femme fatale is willing to go to great extremes to find the perfect replacement for her recently deceased husband and to finally fulfill her insatiable desire. However, as Elaine's almost pathological-obsession starts leaving an ever-growing trail of love-smitten men in her wake, inevitably, an inquisitive detective will soon disrupt her spell. Is Elaine destined to find her Prince Charming?â€”Nick Riganas

The conservative Catholic Cantone family own and operate a pasta factory in southern Italy. At a family dinner, parents Vincenzo and Stefania Cantone plan on turning over the factory to their two sons, Antonio Cantone and Tommaso Cantone. The younger Tommaso, who has returned home from business school in Rome for this dinner, has his own important news which he plans on divulging at that dinner. Beforehand, he tells Antonio his news. He is not in business school and does not want to run the factory, leaving that to Antonio. Rather, he wants to stay in Rome to be a writer - he has submitted a manuscript of a novel to a publisher - but more importantly that he is gay. Tommaso is certain that their parents will not take any of this news well. But before Tommaso can make his statement at the dinner, Antonio, who has been working at the factory for years, drops his own bombshell of news on the family, which results in Vincenzo disowning Antonio and having a mild heart attack. Tommaso feels that he has no other choice now but to keep quiet, and stay to run the factory while his father recuperates. A visit from Rome by Tommaso's flamboyant gay friends - including Tommaso's lover, Marco - may make life difficult for Tommaso as he tries to balance his priorities in life. Tommaso's paternal grandmother, who started the factory, who is known as the loose cannon of the family and who has a long kept secret of her own, may have her own say in what happens in the family.â€”Huggo

Near the deer hunting season in the small town of Wheelsy, a meteor falls on the woods with an egg of alien worm. Along the night, the local Starla Grant refuses to have sex with her husband Grant Grant and the upset man goes to a bar to have some drinks. He sees the weird egg on the grass, and when he touches it, the egg releases an alien parasite that dominates Grant's brain. Along the next days, Grant has an insatiable hunger for meat, and his hostage body is transforming. Starla and the local sheriff Bill Pardy try to find a way to stop Grant, the leader of a new breed.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

Based on Paolo Villaggio's books "Fantozzi" and "Il secondo, tragico Fantozzi", which are popular in Italy, this film tells the story of an unfortunate accountant's life over the course of one year, shown in a variety of sketches, segments, and provocative sequences presenting Fantozzi as a very unlucky person indeed.â€”Stefano "SWEEVO" Pavone

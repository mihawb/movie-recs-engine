Simpson) was nearly murdered while investigating suspicious activities in a boat named "I Love You". Meanwhile, Frank returns to the USA and visits him.

He is then attracted to Ludwig's secretary, Jane Spencer (Priscilla Beaulieu Presley). Frank asks her out for dinner which Jane politely refuses.

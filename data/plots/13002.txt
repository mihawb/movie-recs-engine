All on his own, the kind widowed ruler, King Randolph, fears that his lively daughter, Princess Genevieve, and her eleven equally high-spirited sisters lack a mother figure. Intent on helping them transform into proper young ladies, the king enlists the help of his poor cousin, Duchess Rowena, to teach the girls a thing or two about manners and the royal etiquette. Instead, the cruel relative bans all singing and dancing in the palace; however, the girls discover a magical entrance to an enchanted world where everything is possible. Can the twelve dancing princesses save the kingdom with their late mother's gift?â€”Nick Riganas

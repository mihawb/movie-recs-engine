Ea, the only daughter of God lives in a remote appartment in Brussels with her extremely vicious and cynical father and her obeyant mother. God is a terrible father who is bored to death. The only thing that makes him escape the untolerable dullness of his routine is to strain people by creating meaningless, but almost sadistic, "laws" mercilessly destroy our beautiful days. But his daughter, like her brother before her, is a sensitive being who has had enough of her father's paranoia. So she sets out on an expedition her brother left unfinished, namely the salvation of the universe from her insanely sick dad. Before that, she destroys her father's computer and publicizes everyone's death date. After escaping, Ea must gather six more apostles in order to end the tyrrany of her father. The apostles are ordinary people whoare deeply shaken by the revelation of their death dates. She helps them find who they trully are and each one of them narrates his own story and creates a gospel, writting the things he's been taught by life, their passions and the moments that defined their personalities. Meanwhile. God is hunting them and gradually discovers how cruel a world he has created and that his powers start leaving him.

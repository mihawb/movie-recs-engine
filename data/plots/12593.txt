In the 1960s, fed up with monotonous college life and police repression, free-spirited Fritz, an impenitent seducer and unrestrained party-animal, decides to explore the world. And just like that, as he flees New York City, heading to San Francisco, Fritz embarks on an endless adventure of illumination. Immersed in a world surrounded by drugs and sex, Fritz takes part in mad orgies, brings about a revolution, incites mass urban riots, and crosses paths with drug-addled Nazi bikers. Will Fritz ever find what he's looking for?â€”Nick Riganas

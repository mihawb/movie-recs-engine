While driving early one morning on their way to a boat outing Andrzej (Leon Niemczyk) and his young somewhat homely wife Krystyna (Jolanta Umecka) nearly run down a Young Boy (Zygmunt Malanowicz) who is hitchhiking. Andrzej initially acts belligerent towards the Young Boy but gives him a ride to the marina. Once there Andrzej asks the Young Boy aboard the boat and the three move out into the still waters of Olszryn, Poland. While spending the day together Andrzej bullies the Young Boy into laboring as a deck hand, while Krystyna slowly transforms into a beautiful women. As male egos collide, the Young Boy wants to be taken back to shore but Anrzej refuses and the ship grounds in the shallows. When they get the boat back to deeper water the wind has stopped and the three spend the night quietly but the next day a fight erupts with Andrzej throwing the Young Boy off the boat to drown. When Krystyna confronts Anrdzej he swims ashore unaware that the Young Boy returns to the boat for possible revenge.

A Bushman in the Kalahari desert encounters technology for the first time--in the shape of a Coke bottle. He takes it back to his people, and they use it for many tasks. The people start to fight over it, so he decides to return it to the Gods--where he thinks it came from. Meanwhile, we are introduced to a clumsy biologist, a schoolteacher assigned to a small village, and a despotic revolutionary.â€”Colin Tinto <cst@imdb.com>

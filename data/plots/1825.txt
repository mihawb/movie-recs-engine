After years of absence, the humble trucker, Lincoln Hawk, gets to see his estranged 12-year-old son, Michael, when his mortally-ill ex-wife, Christina, requests Lincoln to pick up their son from the military school on the day of his graduation. With the intention of making up for lost time, the father and son take a long drive home in the big rig; however, Hawk will soon realise that reconnecting with the troubled Michael is not an easy job--at least not until the boy discovers Lincoln's talent for arm-wrestling. With the International Arm-Wrestling Championship in Las Vegas just around the corner, Hawk has only a couple of days to win back his son's long-lost trust, and in the process, compete in a dangerous tournament against behemoths twice his size. Is Lincoln's determination enough to put him over the top?â€”Nick Riganas

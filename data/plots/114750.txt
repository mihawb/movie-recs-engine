At prestigious Winchester University, biracial student Samantha White begins her radio show, "Dear White People, the amount of Black friends required not to seem racist has just been raised to two. Sorry, your weed man Tyrone doesn't count." Sam becomes president of the all-Black residential hall Parker-Armstrong, whose existence is facing extinction in the name of diversification. TV reality show "Black Face/White Place" smells gold in Sam's story and decides to follow it, rejecting the proposal of fellow Black student Coco Conners, who pitched a show titled "Doing Time at an Ivy League." The clamor over Sam's rise also becomes a career-defining opportunity for Black misfit Lionel Higgins when he is asked to join the school's lily-white newspaper staff to cover the controversy, even though he secretly knows little about Black culture.â€”Sundance Film Festival

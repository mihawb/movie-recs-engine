One year after Vincent van Gogh's (Robert Gulaczyk's) suicide, Postman Joseph Roulin (Chris O'Dowd) asks his son Armand (Douglas Booth) to deliver van Gogh's last letter to his brother, Theo (Cezary Lukaszewicz). Roulin finds the death suspicious, as merely a few weeks earlier, van Gogh claimed through letters that his mood was calm and normal. Armand reluctantly agrees and heads for Paris. Pere Tanguy (John Sessions), a Montmartre art supplier, tells Armand that Theo actually died six months after Vincent. He suggests that Armand travel to Auvers-Sir-Oise and look for Dr. Paul Gachet (Jerome Flynn), who housed van Gogh after his release from an asylum, shared his love for art, and attended the funeral. Once there, Armand learns that the doctor is out on business. So he stays at the same inn that van Gogh did during his time in the area. There he meets the temporary proprietress Adeline Ravoux (Eleanor Tomlinson), who was fond of van Gogh and who was also surprised by his death. At her suggestion, Armand visits the local boatman, who informs him that Van Gogh kept close company with Dr. Gachet's sheltered daughter, Marguerite (Saoirse Ronan). When Armand visits her, Marguerite denies and is angered when Armand implies that van Gogh's suicidal mood could have resulted from an argument with her father.

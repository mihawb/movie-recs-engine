After the fall of a ruthless dictator somewhere in a South American country in its first days of freedom, Paulina Escobar, a furious teenage revolutionary and torture survivor, and her husband, Gerardo, a former political activist and now an elite lawyer with a knotty mission, are struggling to get past that tragic era. Isolated in their secluded house, Paulina is struck with terror, when in the dead of night, Gerardo brings home a stranger, the friendly and helpful Dr Roberto Miranda, whom she recognises as her repulsive tormentor. Unfortunately, as Paulina was blindfolded throughout her imprisonment, she has to rely only on the memory of her senses and her angry determination to get his confession--but was the clean-handed Doctor, really her captor? In the end, can the confused Gerardo trace the truth, and above all, how does one punish the wicked?â€”Nick Riganas

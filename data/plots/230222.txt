Stranded in the heart of the untamed African jungle, orphaned John Jr, the helpless little son of the famous industrialist John Greystoke, finds a new family in the shape of a mighty female silverback gorilla. And, almost two decades later, Johnny becomes Tarzan or the fearless Ape without Fur. But, before long, Tarzan finds himself up against the unscrupulous young CEO of Greystoke Energies, William Clayton, as his evil plan to exploit the unharnessed force of a prehistoric meteor threatens the already fragile equilibrium of the forest. Now, in search of fragments of the rare celestial body, Clayton will stop at nothing to rob the jungle of its invaluable resource. However, not if Tarzan and Jane, the adventurous daughter of the late explorer James Porter, can help it. Will the ruthless invaders desecrate Tarzan's virgin realm?â€”Nick Riganas

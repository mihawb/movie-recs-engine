Its a normal day on the Thousand Sunny until Nami reads the newspaper to the rest of the crew about the East Blue being attacked. Luffy then decides that they will go back to the East Blue to help out. Seconds later a big floating ship passes over the Sunny and Nami wishes to warn them about a storm coming by. The captain, impressed by Nami's navigating skills, tricks the Straw Hats and kidnaps Nami. Will the crew be able to save her, or will she join the other crew instead?â€”popian3, edited by Kotehos

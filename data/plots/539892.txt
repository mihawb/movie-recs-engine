A seven-year-old girl, Chloe, who lives with her father, was told that the outside world was dangerous and was spending lonely days in her house. One day, she left the house while her father was asleep, and she was approached by an old man in an ice cream truck standing in front of her house. The old man tells her about the fact that Chloe's mother is alive and the mysterious power she has. Chloe, who was scolded by her father for going out, awakened her special ability by raising her emotions. The ability was a very dangerous thing to manipulate a person's mind. Chloe works with a grandfather and a father with different abilities to rescue a detained mother.â€”Linda Jenkinson

Milan-based Giovanni and Lidia Pontano are solely going through the motions of being husband and wife. They have not explicitly stated their dissatisfaction with the marriage beyond the odd snide comment, nor have they mentioned anything to friends or colleagues. However, there has been infidelity, if not in actuality then at least in intent. They still spend much of their time together out of habit, mostly out of their apartment, to add some third-party aspect to their lives. A 24-hour period in their lives is presented. An early outing they have together this day is to visit their terminally-ill friend Tommaso Garani, also a writer, in the hospital. But a couple of Giovanni and Lidia's other joint outings are business ones, specifically to promote Giovanni's just published novel, which is just the latest in a successful career. Although several incidents will highlight the divide they are facing emotionally, the events of an evening garden party at the home of wealthy businessman Sig. Gherardini prove to be the most illuminating in showing Giovanni and Lidia's marriage in its current state.â€”Huggo

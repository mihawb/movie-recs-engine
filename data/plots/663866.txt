Margaret Thatcher's England. As an unstoppable wave of hardcore movies that depict butchering, sadism, and murder--the infamous video nasties--invades Britain, mousy Enid, a diligent, scissor-happy film censor working at the British Board of Film Classification, is convinced that she is helping society. However, when an extreme horror film inspires a family man to slaughter his wife and children, Enid's repressed childhood trauma emerges from the past, triggering a destructive obsession over her sister Nina's disappearance. Now, Enid is powerless to resist. But just how far down the rabbit hole is she prepared to go to unearth the truth?â€”Nick Riganas

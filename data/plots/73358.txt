Johnny Worricker is a lifelong member of the Security service. He's no longer married and realizes that he's not much of a father to his now adult daughter. His boss, Benedict Baron, asks him to review a particularly sensitive file that reveals not only that the CIA has illegal prisons around the world but that the British Prime Minister, Alec Beasley, was aware of them and knew about them all along. When Baron dies of a heart attack the Prime Minister personally tells Worricker that he has 12 hours to return the incriminating file or face the consequences. Johnny enlists the aid of his neighbor Nancy Pierpan but in the end he has to compromise, leaving him in a delicate situation.Continues with "Turks & Caicos". Written by garykmcd

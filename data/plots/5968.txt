Teddy Pierce--an old-fashioned family man with a caring wife, and two teenage daughters who lead a simple life--is, without a doubt, as faithful as a dog. Clearly, a man of his strong will would never lay his eyes on a woman twice; up until that fateful day in the underground parking lot at his work. There, a tall and slender brunette--a bombshell of a woman, all dressed up in a deliciously sexy red dress--catches the unsuspecting Teddy's attention--and, suddenly--an insatiable urge of an unprecedented scale will start building up, forcing the once-tame paterfamilias to have more, more, more. However, is this scarlet temptation Teddy's ultimate chance to bring some adventure to his boring married life? And, above all, will he ever see again that mysterious and seductively alluring woman in red?â€”Nick Riganas

In the early 20th century, Gustav von Aschenbach (Sir Dirk Bogarde), once married with a daughter, is a Munich-based composer of experimental music. Now a frail middle-aged man in ill health, he is advised by his doctor to get complete rest. As such, he is alone at the Grand Hotel, on the Lido in Venice, to convalesce. He and his friend Alfred (Mark Burns) have had many a philosophical discussion about the concept of beauty, not only as it applies to his oft-not-appreciated music, but as it applies to the arts and life in general. Gustav believes that the nature of beauty can dominate one on a scientific level rather than an emotional level. He becomes obsessed with a Polish teenager, Tadzio (Björn Andrésen), who is staying at the hotel with his sisters and mother. Most of Gustav's interactions with Tadzio are furtive yet still intense gazes from afar. As time progresses, Gustav admits to himself that that obsession has turned into love with not a word spoken between them. On an emotional level, he is torn by his feelings, at first trying to escape physically, then doing anything to remain within Tadzio's view. What happens between Gustav and Tadzio could be dictated by issues external to them.—Huggo

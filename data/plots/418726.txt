Best friends Lucia and Maria have known each other from the beginning of their lives, but have very different tastes and behaviors. Lucia is done with men; Maria can never be without one. One night the perfect man shows up in Maria's bed: handsome, sensible, mature, and passionate. The next morning brings up misunderstandings and lies that split up the two friends and make them take a break from each other. Maybe that young man met by chance is really the one every woman seeks, because with his simple theories he manages to paint the perfect picture of the two women's lives.â€”Marco Bonelli

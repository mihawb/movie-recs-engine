Marcello is in the compartment of an Italian train, facing forward, when the mineral water of the woman seated across from him starts falling toward him. He catches the bottle and makes eye contact, then follows her when she leaves the compartment. For a few moments she finds him attractive too. Then suddenly she gets off the train and starts walking through a field. Marcello follows her, loses her, and finds himself in a large hotel surrounded by women. A feminist conference is taking place and he tries to escape.â€”Dale O'Connor <daleoc@interaccess.com>

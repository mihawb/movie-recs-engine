Europe, 1916. From the bloodshed and chaos of World War I, a man, whose name would go down in history, stood out. At the age of twenty-four, Manfred von Richthofen was already a fearless ace-pilot of the Imperial German Air Service. But, was he a gentleman, a warrior, or an adventurer? Striking fear into the hearts of men, and respected by his enemies, including the expert Canadian pilot of the Allied Forces, Captain Roy Brown, Manfred von Richthofen made a name for himself as the notorious Red Baron, after painting his plane red. However, when Manfred is hospitalised and meets the soft-spoken nurse, Käte, he will begin to realise that, behind the white-knuckle dogfights and the glory, lies the real, and utterly horrible face of war.—Nick Riganas

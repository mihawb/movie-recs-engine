Chicago, December 1988. More than anything in the world, eleven-year-old Jake Doyle wants to get his hands on the holy grail of home entertainment: an expensive, eye-popping video game console. Now, against the backdrop of the glorious 8-bit era, Jake and his equally obsessed friends are willing to go to great lengths to get the coveted third-generation entertainment system; however, the road to success is fraught with disappointment. Indeed, the stakes are high, and only a few lucky kids will manage to play the famous console. What will it take to bring a little twinkle and make this the best 8-bit Christmas ever?â€”Nick Riganas

When a rugby team's plane to Chile crashes in the Andes Mountains, they will do anything to survive, even if that means they must eat their dead loved ones as food. Nando, Reberto, and Tintin leave the plane to find the tail to work the radio. Once they bring it back, it doesn't work, so they go out again but Tintin stayed back or went back. Nando and Roberto find the green valleys of Chile and finally breach the Andes and find help. The obstacles they faced were avalanches, food, shelter, and a way to escape. They accused the pilots of being drunk and it was their fault. The good thing is that they escaped.

When a friend and fellow agent is found dead under suspicious circumstances in a close-knit Appalachian community, it falls to the veteran EPA Agent Jack Taggert to shed light on the mystery. Posing as a worker, Taggert soon discovers that the ruthless businessman, Orin Hanner Jr, keeps dumping toxic waste into an abandoned coal mine shaft, posing a threat to public health and all living things in the picturesque valley. Now, Jack has to deal with the unscrupulous criminals who destroy nature. But, can one man working alone right a wrong and restore peace?â€”Nick Riganas

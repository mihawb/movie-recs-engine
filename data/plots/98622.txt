In a not-so-distant future, against the backdrop of a ravaged post-apocalyptic Earth, Nine, a brave animated rag doll, struggles to survive. Faced with unknown perils and the grotesque monstrosities of a pitiless world, sooner or later, Nine will have to confront his arch-enemy: the ghastly Cat Beast, a formidable adversary decimating his clan. And, pretty soon, there will be no one left. Is all hope lost?â€”Nick Riganas

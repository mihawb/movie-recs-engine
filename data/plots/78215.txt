At the beginning of World War II, a hostile chance encounter in the skies above the harsh Norwegian wilderness leaves two aircraft - one British, one German - shot down in a remote and isolated region. By strange coincidence the crews seek shelter in the same cabin. They must battle to survive the brutal winter in order to get back to the war - and to fighting one another. Although war has made them enemies, as the days go by animosity proves hard to maintain. Mutual need leads to unlikely friendships, and the rules of war must be put aside.â€”Magnolia Pictures

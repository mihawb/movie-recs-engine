Catherine Morland is taken to Bath, England by the wealthy Mr. and Mrs. Allen and introduces her to Georgian society. There she meets the social-climbing Isabella and John Thorpe, the handsome Henry Tilney and elegant Eleanor Tilney. After making an impression on Henry and Eleanor's father, the Tilneys invite her to their country mansion, Northanger Abbey. Catherine falls in love with Henry but realizes that love can be fickle and that money - and not just love - is an important consideration in the marriage business. The story is based on Jane Austen's novel of the same name, "Northanger Abbey."â€”M. C. Gomez

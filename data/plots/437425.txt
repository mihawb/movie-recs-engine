Juliette is totally incapable of making up her mind about anything, so even at 40 she still asks her father and her two best friends to choose everything for her. When her love life crosses the road of Paul, then of Stephen, each as charming and different as the other, necessarily, the heart of Juliette swings. For the first time, nobody can decide for her.â€”OzzyPsycko

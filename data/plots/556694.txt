In her quest to find the common truths behind humankind's stories, British narratologist Dr Alithea Binnie finds herself in Istanbul. When Alithea stumbles upon an intriguing, hand-blown crystal bottle, the curious academic unleashes the supernatural force living in the peculiar glass container: the Djinn, or the Genie in the bottle. As the otherworldly entity enthrals Alithea with extraordinary stories spanning three millennia, the shocked professor has three wishes to fulfil her heart's desires. However, Alithea already knows that there's no story about wishing that is not a cautionary tale. After all, trickster Djinns love to manipulate humans' intimate longings to serve their own selfish ends. And that's the problem. What happens if Alithea makes no wish at all?â€”Nick Riganas

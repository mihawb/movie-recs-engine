An otherwise lovely and safe getaway in the lush English countryside soon ends up in a disaster, when an inadvertent mistake traps the helpless Tinker Bell in the small fairy house of the pixie-loving young human named Lizzy Griffiths. However, as both girls form a beautiful friendship, Tink's fairy companions--Iridessa, Silvermist, Rosetta, and Fawn--boldly set out on a mission outside Pixie Hollow to rescue their beloved tinker who think has been kidnapped. Will Lizzy's sceptical dad believe in fairies?â€”Nick Riganas

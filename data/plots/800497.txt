Not knowing what to expect, Finn Wheeler, a considerate US Forest Ranger, sets foot in the snow-covered town of Beaverfield, unaware that the proposed construction of a gas pipeline has thrown the small community into crisis, dividing its citizens. Indeed, as a severe blizzard traps the dysfunctional inhabitants in the local lodge along with cheerful new mail-carrier Cecily Moore, festering resentment ratchets up the hysteria, and the word "lycanthrope" pops up. It falls to kind Finn to prevent everyone from killing one another: someone--or something--is hunting them down, one by one. But in a dog-eat-dog world, is there a place for nice guys when werewolves are within?â€”Nick Riganas

Jake and Kyra live with their daughter Mika and Yang, Mika's beloved companion: an android, a previously owned robotic child they bought from Brothers and Sisters Incorporated. When Yang malfunctions, Jake searches for a way to repair him. Brothers and Sisters recommend replacing Yang, which means his body will decompose. Not wanting to upset Mika, Jake becomes determined to save his robotic child. In a flashback, Yang reassures a curious Mika that she is still part of the family despite being adopted. Jake takes Yang to Russ, a repairman, who discovers what he claims is a hidden camera inside of Yang. It looks like a memory bank. Jake goes home and watches Yang's memories. What secret will Jake find out?â€”Frank Liesenborgs <frank.liesenborgs@gmail.com>

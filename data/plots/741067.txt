A former army soldier in special ops, Jesse Freeman is now working as a security guard at the Odyssey Center, the arena in Phoenix, to be able to spend more time with his wife, Alisha, and two preteen children, Ryan and Mara. No one in his new working environment nor his children know about his former life, Ryan and Mara who only know about he never being there for them in the key moments in their life. Ryan, still angry, acts out against his father, calling his job lame, despite Jesse having gotten him and Mara tickets to the season opening basketball game between the hometown Falcons and the New York Knights. The VIP at the game is businessperson and philanthropist Diana Smart, the owner of the arena who is seen as being the key to the city's revitalization. Mara going missing at the arena and Jesse seeing a bunch of "colleagues" he doesn't recognize is when Jesse comes to realize that a group has overtaken security at the arena, probably having killed all his real colleagues, and having taken Mara hostage. The leader of who are cyber-terrorists, he calling himself Alpha, has as his outward goal to extort Diana of all her money, it only one minor part of his end goal which includes killing all in the arena by the end of the game if need be. Jesse, with the help of Gus, the janitor on duty who is a geek about all that is the arena, has as his initial goal to save Mara and protect Ryan, but he may end up having the goal of saving all at the arena if he learns the full extent of what is going on.â€”Huggo

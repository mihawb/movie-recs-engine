The egocentric, stubborn, and grumpy Hollywood Director John Wilson (Clint Eastwood) invites his friend Pete Verrill (Jeff Fahey) to write the screenplay of his next movie that will be a masterpiece in his opinion. He convinces Producer Paul Landers (George Dzundza) that the movie must be shot in Africa and they travel to the continent. Once in Africa, John becomes obsessed with hunting a specific elephant and neglects his cast and crew prioritizing the hunting with the native Kivu (Boy Mathias Chuma).â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

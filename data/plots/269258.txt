10-year-old Tilda and her parents deal with her grandfather Amandus who has Alzheimer's. Tilda and Amandus have always had a special connection; now Amandus' condition is getting worse since his wife's death, and Tilda's parents, Sarah and Niko, don't think they can take care of him anymore and start talking about nursing homes. Tilda doesn't want her granddad to go to one of those, so she kidnaps him and helps him fulfill his last big dream: to see again Venice, the place where he and his wife first met and fell in love. A very special adventure begins: a 10-year-old girl and a 70-year-old Alzheimers's patient are on their way to Italy.

Dreaming of moving out and making their mark on the world, even though their adopted big sister Ellie believes they are not ready to be on their own, prehistoric possum twins Crash and Eddie summon up the courage to leave the nest after the events of Ice Age: Collision Course (2016). But it is a jungle out there. And before long, the tiny explorers wind up back in the dinosaur-ridden Lost World: the subterranean realm of expert survivalist Buck Wild, the extreme one-eyed weasel from Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs (2009), and a new megalomaniac villain bent on world domination. Do the reckless brothers have what it takes to survive reality?â€”Nick Riganas

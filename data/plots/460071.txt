1892 Fall River, Massachusetts. Lizzie Borden, a lonesome 32-year-old unmarried woman, is at war with her family. On the one hand, her ruthless businessman father Andrew openly admits that his daughter is a burden, while on the other hand, Lizzie is convinced that her bitter stepmother Abby has married her father for his wealth. And as if that weren't enough, Uncle John is up to no good. As the arrival of Bridget Sullivan, the Bordens' 25-year-old Irish live-in maid, paves the way for forbidden feelings and a secret relationship, suspicion and menacing anonymous notes ratchet up the tension, culminating in a brutal emotional outburst on August 4, 1892.â€”Nick Riganas

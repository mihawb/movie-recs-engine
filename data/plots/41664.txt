After 30 years in the big corporation, Ugo Fantozzi retires. Suddenly he needs things to do in everyday life and he tries a number of activities: helping Pina with her shopping, babysitting granddaughter Uga, traveling to Venice, and learning golf. He then fakes documents to get a new job, but he becomes a hypochondriac and doesn't even take a long-awaited chance with Miss Silvani.â€”Alessio F. Bragadini <alessio@dsnet.it>

Mercenary missions and other strong-arm tasks are what veteran tough guy DC (Ray Stevenson) lives for. When he and his motley crew of battle-worn soldiers-for-hire are offered a large amount of cash from Hunt (Julian Wadham) they take it. What is presented as a 48-hour mission to go into Eastern Europe and pick up some mysterious package and return, becomes something quite different when they arrive at an abandoned World War 2 outpost. Going through the facility they discover old Nazi relics and documents of some scientific experiments that were conducted on German soldiers, and a "breather", an emaciated man left for dead who only sits and stares. As Hunt discovers what he's come for, a strange electronic machine that possibly alters reality, uniform-clad specters begin to appear and kill off the collected group of mercenaries. When it is learned that the Nazi war machine may have been able to apply Albert Einstein's theory of relativity to create a master generation of other-worldly unstoppable soldier, DC and Hunt and the rest of the men realize they are in the fight of their lives.

As he arrives, female Vampires are rising from their tombs in the castle as the evil Dracula watches. Then Renfield enters, though he is leery to. Of course after seeing some creepy creatures scurrying around the castle, he is greeted by the infamous Count, who bids him"welcome". Later, Renfield confirms that he kept his visit to Dracula's castle a secret, and then they discuss the sale of the castle which is what Renfield came for.They say good night and Renfield prepares to turn in. Three female vampires enter his room as he passes out from an encounter from the vampire bat (Dracula). In the next scene, Renfeild is shown as Dracula's ghoul that wakes him after sunset.

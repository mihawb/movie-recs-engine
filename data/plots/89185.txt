High school student Tara (Debby Ryan) is so painfully shy that she dreads speaking to anyone in the hallways or getting called on in class. But in the privacy of her bedroom she does pod casts and rocks out as an anonymous radio host with her listeners. When her stepfather finds she is "Radio Rebel" he hires her on Seattle's best FM radio station, SLAM FM. Tara surprises herself by blossoming behind the mike into confident, "Radio Rebel" -- and to everyone's shock, she's a hit! Gavin, Tara's secret crush, raves about the mysterious DJ's awesome taste in music. The whole school ends up hating her when Principal Morano cancels prom and demands "Radio Rebel" to reveal her identity to be punished. "Radio Rebel" changes everybody's minds by calling on a "morp", (prom spelled backwards) so everybody can express themselves the way they truly are! "Radio Rebel" is nominated as morp queen and wins! To prevent Principal Morano from expelling Tara the whole school stands up for her by chanting "I'm Radio Rebel!!!".

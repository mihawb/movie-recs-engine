Spring has finally arrived in the snow-covered landscapes of the frigid Ice Age--and with Easter just around the corner--the enterprising prehistoric sloth, Sid, decides to look after the eggs of the community's working parents. However, Squint--the unscrupulous former bunny-pirate who thirsts for retribution--steals the precious eggs, forcing Manny and his friends to set out on a thorough search, in history's first egg hunt. Will they manage to find all the eggs?â€”Nick Riganas

Rémy, a university history professor in Montréal, describes himself as a lusty socialist. He and his ex-wife Louise's marriage broke up long ago because of his philandering, his mistresses including several of their closest mutual friends and some of his students. Rémy and Louise have remained on good terms with each other, as they have with those closest friends/ex-mistresses. One person who is estranged from Rémy is his wealthy grown son Sébastien, a London financial risk manager. Sébastien hates how his father's philandering broke up their family, leaving Louise to manage him and his sister Sylvaine on her own; Rémy totally abhors his son's capitalist ideals. When they learn that Rémy is in the hospital possibly facing a terminal-cancer prognosis, Sébastien and his fiancée Gaëlle decide to fly back to Montréal to be by his mother's side and support her in taking care of Rémy's needs in what look like his last days. But the situation does not heal the fundamental rifts between father and son. Even in constant pain and admitting that he is scared of his mortality, Rémy wants to live by his socialist ideal of universal health care, not wanting to jump a queue based on money, and Sébastien wants to throw money at any problem. But in making Rémy's last days comfortable and happy, they might come to the realization that being humanistic surpasses all else.—Huggo

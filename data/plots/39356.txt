In late 1984 in the small settlement of Raukokore on the North Island of New Zealand, 11-year-old Alamein Ranginui, called Boy by most who know him, is a Maori in the care of his paternal grandmother as his mother Joanie died 7 years ago in childbirth and his father Alamein has long been in jail for robbery. Boy and his Nan live with his 7-year-old brother Rocky and several of the boys' cousins. While Rocky has been made to believe that he has magic powers, Boy is prone to fantasy, often dreaming about a life with his father and the person with whom he is most obsessed: Michael Jackson. He also has a crush on a female classmate named Chardonnay. While Nan takes off for a week or so to attend a funeral in Wellington, she leaves Boy in charge of the house and the other children. During that time, they receive an unexpected visit from Alamein, now out of jail, and two of his friends, Juju and Chuppa. Because of his fantasies about his father, Boy welcomes the three into the house with open arms and plans to take Rocky with them when they go, as he believes that's what families do. Boy learns that they have come for "buried treasure"--in reality the money from the robbery; Alamein can't remember exactly where on the property he buried it--which only reinforces Boy's notion that he and Rocky and their dad can live a good life together. Only in spending time with his dad, especially as it relates to the treasure and money in general, will Boy learn if his dreams of being with his dad are worth it.â€”Huggo

The school teacher Rick Latimer is drinking with friends in a bar when he sees his former wife dating her lawyer responsible for their divorce. Rick smashes up the car of the lawyer, is arrested and the school board sends him to the notorious Brandel High School as an alternative to be fired. Without any other option, Rick moves and finds a school dominated by gangs with students rejected from other schools. He joins the students and tells no more for that situation. The chief of the security Jake Phillips believes Rick is crazy but soon he supports the principal attitudes. But the drug lord Victor Duncan is not happy with the new principal and promises to kill him.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

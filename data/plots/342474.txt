The first scene is of a baptism of two babies with Jenny holding one of the babies. Her parents in the audience are discussing the fact that Jenny's running out of time to find a husband and the fact that Jenny feels guilty about something but they don't know what. Later, we see the family at the parent's house. Jenny arrives at the house and her brother forcibly introduces her to a man called Tommy. Tommy says he has to leave but offers to call her some time which she agrees to. As Jenny leaves, her brother tells Tommy not to bother calling her as she won't call back. When Jenny goes into the kitchen she gets into an argument with her sister who tells her she needs to find someone and Jenny tells her that for all they know she could already be in a relationship. Her sister then assumes that Jenny is in a relationship with a married man as she has never brought the person home and tells her mom stating that Jenny has always been jealous of her life as she's married with kids. Later we see Jenny talking to her father in the garage. Her father asks her to not tell anyone that he is smoking to which she answers that she's never told on him. She admits that she does want to be married and that she is seeing someone. She says that she has found the right person but when her dad asks her "when's the wedding?" she answers "I don't know". Her mother, in the dining room, calls Jenny over and Jenny clarifies that she is not with a married man. After they reconcile Jenny hugs her mom.
That night, her mom and dad are in bed and her dad tells her that he thinks the man he's seeing is not willing to commit to her and that that must be the issue. They talk about how secretive Jenny has become.

Ugo Fantozzi has been ejected from Heaven and is sent back to Earth for a short period of time until the staff in Heaven can find him a place. Fantozzi goes through a variety of unfortunate experiences, such as rescuing his retro-punk granddaughter Uga and needing to pay a huge telephone bill full of chat-line conversations. He gets arrested instead of his ex-boss, who was originally charged with corruption. Just as he's about to enjoy the World Cup Final with Italy, he's called back to Heaven. Will he ever find peace?â€”Stefano "SWEEVO" Pavone

Berke is devastated when his girlfriend Allison kicks him out. She takes up with cocky Striker, who claims fame as a singer, and the two of them audition for the school's "Midsummer Night's Dream" musical. Berke follows suit, much to the annoyance of his basketball team buddies Felix and Bentley. Our hero finds himself not only in the play but eventually as one of the leads, partly due to help from Felix's sister Kelly. As First Night approaches, questions need answering - Will Berke and Striker come to blows? Can Dennis take over as the lead dancer? Isn't Kelly nicer than Allison anyway?â€”J-26

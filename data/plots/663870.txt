However, on his return, Markus has an unexpected encounter with the statistical analyst, Otto, one of the few survivors of the accident, who is convinced that there is more to this tragedy than meets the eye. Indeed, it seems that many secrets are hidden in plain sight. Now, pained and lethally dangerous Markus has no other choice but to delve deep into the mind-boggling world of possibilities to get answers to his unspoken questions. But, can he make sense of death?â€”Nick Riganas

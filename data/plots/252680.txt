Allyson Field is a young mother who is having a most unhappy Mother's Day. At first glance, she seems to have a life that many would envy. She is happily married to her loving husband Sean and they have three lively, adorable children. However, as Allyson types on her "mommy blog", she is beset with anxiety and feelings of unworthiness. She describes herself as a "freaky clean freak" who actually sees beauty in a padded cell. She has paranoid delusions about her children getting salmonella and child welfare workers taking them away. She realizes that she is living her simple dream of being a decent wife and mother and feels like a horrible person because of her inner demons..

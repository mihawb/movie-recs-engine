Pierre Dulaine (Antonio Banderas) is a renowned professional ballroom dancer, who teaches ballroom dancing at his Manhattan dance studio. After seeing a car being vandalized by a student outside an inner-city high school, Pierre Dulaine walks into the school to talk to the Principal (Alfre Woodard). She has no time for him and to get rid of him she throws him a challenge, that he could make a difference by working with her worst students. Pierre Dulaine accepts the challenge and volunteers to teach ballroom dancing to a variety of students that have been sent to detention. The students are very skeptical of Pierre Dulaine, especially, when they find out that he wants to teach them ballroom dancing. All they know is hip-hop dancing. Dulaine's commitment and ability to change and adapt dance moves, eventually bring the student to his side. Together, they create a new style of dance and enter a major ballroom dance competition in New York City. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy)

This Russian film is mis understood because of its grand title,its much more, though not in a violent sense.Yes, it has scenes of bloody action,what film about urban warfare wouldnt ? However at its heart,its a film of rebirth in violent times,what could be more topical today?
Beginning in the turmoil of the Fukushima disaster, a Russian rescue team is trying to save some trapped young German girls in whats left of a buildings rubble.Therein starts a flashback retelling of a band of Russian soldiers and a girl mixed in with a German officer and his forced young Russian girl lover,both squaring off over a building in rubble.Ah symmetry and could be corny right ? WRONG !!! Perhaps its being forced to read those subtitles,it is in Russian spoken word,that invests you in the story.It brings to mind two other films,Enemy at the gates,and Miracle at St. Anna,however a far more intense experience for me.
Not wanting to tell much more,it is a rich emotional portrait of simple lives in the middle of all encompassing war.If you just want bang for your buck,you might be disappointed as there are films with more mindless violence BUT if you a story of hope in the middle of despair THEN enjoy.

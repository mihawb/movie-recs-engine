Gigi, living in the Belle Époque era of Paris, is training to be a courtesan- a highly educated and cultured woman who will become a society darling and mistress to wealthy men. She is mentored by her kind but firm Grandmother who has raised her and her glamorous, flamboyant Aunt Alicia. Both try to teach her the ways of good manners, first class diamonds and rolling cigars however the vivacious and idealistic tomboy is resistant. Her respite from her lessons comes in the form of her good friend Gaston - a wealthy aristocrat and playboy who is bored by the decadent but superficial world he inhabits. The two have a dear playful friendship. However with Gigi growing up and Gaston's current mistress being caught up in scandal can these two escape the inevitable roles their two worlds seemed determine to place on them and perhaps explore the true feelings that lie beneath their friendship? All this takes place under the eye of Honore Lachaille (played by the legendary Maurice Chevalier) Gaston's charming, cheery and youthful Uncle who doubles as the movie's narrator and Gaston's mentor in the story. Comedy, romance and many a delightful song ensue.—LadyN1

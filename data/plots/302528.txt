Coached at a distance by his rest home friend Max Rosenbaum (Martin Landau), Zev Gutman (Christopher Plummer) is led step-by-step on a search for an ex-Nazi prison camp guard living under the assumed name of Rudy Kurlander. The Wiesenthal Center has found four possible suspects and Gutman must find - and execute - the right one in retaliation for his own family's death at Auschwitz. Benjamin August's script skillfully builds the tension of Gutman's somewhat haphazard search toward an ending that is so surprising that you'll just have to see it for yourself.â€”Jack Kintner

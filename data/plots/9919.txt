Benjamin, an ad executive, is trying to land a big account, only his boss thinks that it needs a feminine touch, so he considers giving it to a couple of female execs. Benjamin makes a wager with them that if he can get a woman to fall in love with him he gets the account. He lets the female execs choose the girl. They choose Andie, a writer for Composure magazine whom they had met earlier and learned she is doing an article called "How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days". Knowing that she's going to be impossible, they don't tell him that. Ben tries his best to woo her while she does her best to drive him away.â€”rcs0411@yahoo.com

In 1976, two Palestinian and two German terrorists hijacked Air France Flight 139 en-route from Tel Aviv to Paris. They held the passengers and crew hostage at Entebbe, Uganda and demanded a ransom of five million dollars for the airplane, and the release of fifty-three Palestinian and pro-Palestinian militants, forty of whom were prisoners in Israel. When all diplomatic efforts failed, the Israeli government decided not to negotiate and approved a counter-terrorist hostage rescue operation by Israeli Defense Forces commandos.

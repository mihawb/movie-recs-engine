CIA agent Henry is tasked by his supervisor Vick to close an eight year old hijacking case that ended in tragedy. Vick has recently learned that there is a suspected mole who helped give the perpetrators information to impede the rescue attempt of the passengers. Being cleared by Vick, Henry is sent to interview his former colleague and lover, Celia, a possible suspect due to her abrupt departure from the CIA the day after the hijacking. The now married and retired Celia meets Henry in a California restaurant after he reaches out to her and asks her to dinner. Through multiple perspectives, timelines, and interviews Henry, Vick, and Celia hope to find out what truly transpired that day.â€”madnbryant

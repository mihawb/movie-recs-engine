Polite Vincent Malloy, a fervent 7-year-old Vincent Price aficionado, has only one dream: to become like his idol. With this in mind, young Vincent relives his favourite actor's movies and stories with the help of his unrestrained imagination, performing strange experiments just like in Edgar Allan Poe's tales. However, much to the boy's irritation, his mother somehow manages to stand in the way of his happiness. Poor Vincent, no one understands you.â€”Nick Riganas

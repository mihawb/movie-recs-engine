Véronique is a beautiful young French woman who aspires to be a renowned singer. Weronika lives in Poland, has a similar career goal, and looks identical to Véronique, though the two are not related. Both women contend with the ups and downs of their individual lives, with Véronique embarking on an unusual romance with a puppeteer who may be able to help her with her existential issues. Véronique and Weronika are unaware of each other's existence, yet they sense a spectral companion and an inexplicable, profound bond.—Nick Riganas

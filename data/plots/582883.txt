Academy Award-winner Jean Dujardin (THE ARTIST) is recently divorced and having a mid-life identity crisis. In search of a new life and look, he ditches his past in a roadside petrol station and encounters a vintage fringed deerskin jacket with influential supernatural powers. He relocates to a quiet French alpine village where he is mistaken for an independent filmmaker by an adventurous, enterprising bartender in a sleepy saloon (Adèle Haenel, PORTRAIT OF A LADY ON FIRE) who happens to be an aspiring editor with natural production instincts. The two forge a tenuous allegiance and team up to collaborate on a film inspired by the visionary deerskin jacket.—Mae Moreno

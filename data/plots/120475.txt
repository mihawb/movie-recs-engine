Bardock, Goku's father, was supposed to have died when Freezer's attack hit him along with Planet Vegeta. Instead, he was thrown back in time, to an age where the planet was still inhabited by strange creatures. There he met Freezer's ancestor, the space pirate Chilled, and fought against him to protect the planet.â€”Anime News Network

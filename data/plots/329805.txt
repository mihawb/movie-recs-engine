Tony is a charming woman who met handsome Giorgio at a party. She liked him at first sight, and she also interested him. Gradually, an easy hobby grew into a crazy passion, and they simply could not imagine life without each other. For 10 years they experienced all-consuming love full of boundless happiness and blinding jealousy. But once Tony realized that she could no longer endure this painful love, she decided that it was time for them to break up.â€”Peter-Patrick76 (peter-patrick@mail.com)

After twenty-five years of marriage, mild-mannered Guglielmo, a devout Catholic of impeccable integrity and owner of a religious items shop, experiences the most horrendous wedding anniversary. Having lost faith in love, depressed Guglielmo seeks solace in work; however, his well-organised life is about to turn upside down when sunny, brazen, and equally lovely Luna sets foot in the store, asking for a job. Now, as his newest employee, little by little, effortlessly charming Luna talks Guglielmo into changing everything about his world and maybe, just maybe, summon up the courage to live life to the fullest. Is a dash of blessed madness the missing ingredient in Guglielmo's unexciting reality?â€”Nick Riganas

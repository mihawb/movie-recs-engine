Recently-retired teacher Angelika decides, against her skeptical husband Richard's will, to take in a refugee. Soon afterward, young Nigerian Diallo moves into the Hartmann home, launching a whirlwind of complications ensue. These events not only disrupt the lives of Angelika and Richard's adult children Philip and Sophie, but they also put their own marriage as well as Diallo's chances of integration to the test. Despite all the chaos, hope prevails that the family will recover its stability, confidence, and peace--like the rest of Germany.â€”Wiedemann & Berg Film

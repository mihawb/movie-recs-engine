Nerdy, over-imaginative Sam is the laughing stock of his scouts troop "Pathfinder", even leader Peter sometimes enjoys his embarrassment, while fair deputy leader Kris protects him. On annual woodland camping trip, now on the French border of the Belgian Ardennes, the cool kids joke around the campfire about he legendary evil Kai. However there is a bloody murder spray in the area, and Sam discovers in a tree-house and befriends a strange, knavish creature, called Kai, but nobody believes him before mates' blood has also been spilled needlessly.â€”KGF Vissers

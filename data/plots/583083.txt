Elle Evans (Joey King) just had the most romantic summer of her life with her reformed bad-boy boyfriend Noah Flynn (Jacob Elordi). But now Noah's off to Harvard, and Elle's headed back to high school for her senior year. She'll have to juggle a long-distance relationship, getting into her dream college with her best friend Lee (Joel Courtney), and a new friendship with handsome classmate Marco (Taylor Perez). When Noah grows close to a seemingly-perfect college girl, Elle will have to decide how much she trusts him, and just what - and who - her heart truly wants. Director and screenwriter Vince Marcello returns for THE KISSING BOOTH sequel, based on characters from Beth Reekles' 2012 young adult book.â€”Netflix

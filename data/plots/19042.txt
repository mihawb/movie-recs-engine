When Gabriel's Horn falls from Heaven, Annabelle entrusts Charlie and Itchy to recover it. But once on Earth, Charlie falls in love with an Irish Setter named Sasha LaFleur and finds out about collars that can make him and Itchy solid again. Following Carface, they come across an elderly dog named Red, who gives them the collars for free, but warns them that they'll only last until sundown the next day. But they learn the hard way that things aren't always as they seem, and now in order to make things right, Charlie will have to make a deal with the devil.â€”Anonymous

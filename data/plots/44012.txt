The film is a study of a woman's daily routine and her eventual psychological breakdown.Jeanne Dielman (Delphine Seyrig) is a widowed mother who lives with her son Sylvain (Jan Decorte) in a small apartment in Brussels. She is a meticulous and precise homemaker who spends her days cooking, cleaning, and performing domestic chores. Every day, she prepares and serves the same meals at the same time and carries out her routine with clockwork precision.However, as the film progresses, the audience becomes aware that Jeanne's meticulously ordered life is not as stable as it seems. Her son's absence during the day, coupled with the arrival of a male client (Henri Storck) at her apartment, leads to a gradual psychological unraveling, and the tension mounts as the routine becomes more and more disrupted.On the third day, Jeanne's routine is disrupted as she forgets to turn off the faucet in the kitchen, causing the sink to overflow. This small mistake appears to be the tipping point that sets off a series of psychological events that ultimately lead to Jeanne's breakdown.The climax of the film occurs when Jeanne, unable to cope with the pressure, kills her male client, and the film ends with Jeanne sitting in a chair, motionless, staring blankly ahead."Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles" is a groundbreaking film that explores the monotony and psychological impact of domestic drudgery. The film's slow, deliberate pace and repetitive structure reflect Jeanne's inner turmoil and mental disintegration, and the climax is a shocking and visceral reminder of the dangerous consequences of repressed emotion.

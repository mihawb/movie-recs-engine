Just like a palindrome that reads the same forwards as it does backwards, the intertwined lives of Ana and Otto seem to be governed by a powerful and eloquent circular motif, weaved by pivotal events between the two ends of life's continuum: the beginning and the end. As children, Otto and Ana were brought up as siblings. In adolescence, the timid admiration turns into teenage love, and, as adults, they find themselves separated, only to reunite once again after a long period apart in cold Lapland Finland's Arctic Circle. However, before the machinations of fate, coincidence, and chance, there, under the eternal midnight sun, the esoteric and almost poetic faith that two ardent lovers can be destined to be together, will bind Ana and Otto's non-linear life path. Then, a new cycle will commence. Can the star-crossed lovers of the Arctic Circle deny their destiny?â€”Nick Riganas

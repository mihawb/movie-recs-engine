Semyon Gorbunkov, a kind-hearted and not very clever soviet husband and a father of two, goes on a holiday cruise abroad. Semyon visits a large oriental town accompanied by his cabin mate, friendly and charismatic Gennady. When visiting the old town, Gennady gets rid of him and soon after Semyon accidentally falls right in front of a pharmacy. There the "pharmacy clerks" treat him, put his wounded arm in a cast -- and smuggle a bunch of jewels into it. Semyon goes back to the ship almost at the same time Gennady arrives and fakes a fall in front of the pharmacy. The arm cast with the jewels was destined to him, a professional smuggler. Back in the USSR, Semyon, who is being watched by Gennady and the gang of smugglers, warns the authorities, who apparently do nothing. Then he is discreetly contacted by the Police. An agent propose Semyon to keep the cast on his arm a little longer and to act as bait in order to arrest the whole gang. Unaware of what he is getting into, Semyon agrees --â€”rotoskopova@yandex.com

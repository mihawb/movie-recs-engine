When Takaki became aware that his family would move to Kagoshima, he decided to go see Akari since they would be too far apart to visit each other after he moved. However, when the day came, a severe snowstorm delayed Takaki's trip, and it would be hours before he reached Iwafune, where they promised to meet. The two spend the night together in an abandoned cabin, where copulation is strongly implied.Episode 2: CosmonautTakaki is now in the third year of senior high in Tanegashima, where the Tanegashima Space Center is located.

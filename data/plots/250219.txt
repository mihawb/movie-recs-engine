A chemist and university researcher, barely earning a living, is fired. After meeting a student of his, he learns the street value of drugs. He then designs a "non-illegal" drug and starts selling it with a group of friends, PhD holders working menial jobs and being underpaid. Things get complicated when they earn too much money and get noticed, and their business is frowned upon by a big drug dealer named "Murena".â€”dw-benini

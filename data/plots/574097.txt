Against the backdrop of the working-class city of Roubaix, a commune near the Belgian border, and unprecedented economic depression, the composed police chief, Yacoub Daoud, finds himself roaming the empty night streets of the once-thriving industrial town. It's Christmas eve; however, crime never sleeps, and Daoud, who has a knack for sniffing out the truth, senses that intimidated, tight-lipped Claude and Marie know a lot more than they let on. Now, an arson attack, with no witnesses or video evidence, and the brutal murder of an elderly woman demand answers. But, in a dangerous neighbourhood rife with crime, can the truth shine when everyone is a suspect?â€”Nick Riganas

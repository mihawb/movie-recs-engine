Biographical film about the inventor and designer of small arms Mikhail Timofeevich Kalashnikov. Today it is difficult to find a person who does not know this name. However, not everyone knows what a long and thorny path traveled a self-taught guy to create the legendary AK-47 weapon at the age of 28, which to this day is a symbol of the weapons thought of our time.â€”Peter-Patrick76 (peter-patrick@mail.com)

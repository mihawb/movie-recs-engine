A fascinating movie based on a true story of a girl who loses herself rapidly to what appears to be Schizophrenia. With the unending hope of her parents and boyfriend, they push for an answer that is not as simple as mental illness. Even with all the medical tests demonstrating nothing physically wrong, one doctor feels deeply there is something they're missing. Illiciting the help of a professor who was previously a clinician, he uncovers the truth. A truly inspiring movie.â€”Kerry Dawson

After taking over Dr Habran's community practice in Liège, his young successor, the hard-working, idealistic, compassionate physician, Dr Jenny Davin, picks up where he left off, committing herself to treat welfare patients. Then, Dr Davin, of all people, lightly decides to ignore a young lady in distress, and the next day, the authorities find the poor girl lying dead by the river bank, only a few metres away from her door. As a result, distraught and guilt-ridden Jenny embarks on an almost-obsessive but amateurish investigation all over town to give a name to a nameless grave, bent on finding answers. But only God knows what would have happened if Jenny had answered the door. Could Dr Davin, indeed, have saved the unfortunate unknown girl?—Nick Riganas

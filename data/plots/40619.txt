Different by nature, two complete opposites, the vibrant Day and the gloomy Night meet for the first time ever. This unexpected encounter will start a series of vivid quarrels and silly fights, trying to define who is better. Day has sunny beaches, while on the other hand, Night is adorned by the bright lights. Perhaps a change of perspective will help them see things more clearly.â€”Nick Riganas

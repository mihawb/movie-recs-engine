Marcello runs a dog-grooming business in a decaying Italian resort town. He also does some minor drug dealing, which leaves him open to constant bullying and abuse from Simoncino, a violent thug who dominates the town. Simoncino has enemies and a total disregard for everyone around him; when Marcello finds himself roped into a robbery, it starts a chain of events that leads to the puppy-dog divorced dad biting back hard.

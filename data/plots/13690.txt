Elliot (Joel McHale) incessantly parades proudly with his antlers, until unwise rock-jumping sees them crushed, and thus his new pride. Bride Giselle (Jane Krakowski) thinks Elliot has commitment anxiety when he rushes off to take the lead in the rescue of canine buddy Mr. Weenie (Cody Cameron), who is kidnapped by a poodle's gang of master-devoted pets determined to reconvert him. The feral gang has great trouble even penetrating the heavily guarded holiday resort where the brainwashing attempt is happening.â€”KGF Vissers

In the 60's, in Paris, the middle-aged stockbroker Jean-Louis Joubert is an uptight man that lives with his wife snobbish wife Suzanne on the first floor of a building that belongs to him. Jean-Louis and Suzanne live a boring life and they have two arrogant sons in a boarding school. When their maid quits the job, they hire the charming Spanish maid María Gonzalez and Jean-Louis is introduced to a joyful Spanish community of maids on the 6th floor of his building. Jean-Louis learns about the Spanish costumes and improves the lives of the immigrants with minor support in their live condition. He also rekindles his own life with Maria and her friends. But when Maria unexpectedly returns to Spanish, Jean-Louis rethinks his life and values.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

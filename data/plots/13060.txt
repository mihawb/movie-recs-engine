In the country, a porch swing and windmill move as a flying saucer moves in on a secluded house. A beam pulls a sleeping man out of bed and toward the window. Inside the ship, a small alien is controlling the beam and trying to pass a test. He bumps the man into the wall and throws him all over the house, because the young alien is hitting the wrong switches.
Finally, he gets the man in the ship and gloats to a much larger alien who is watching and making notes on a clip board. The small alien accidentally drops the man before closing the door. The instructor alien drops his clip board and uses the beam to catch the man before he hits the ground. The little alien tries to take the controls and the larger instructor shoves him aside and uses the beam to put the man back in bed and to put the house back the way it was. Then, seeing that he failed, the little alien starts to cry. The larger one lets him take the controls and fly the ship home. Then in the final scene, the ship takes off and then drops on the house. They lift off again and everything was crushed except the area around the man's bed. as the ship takes off, the man is shown still asleep.

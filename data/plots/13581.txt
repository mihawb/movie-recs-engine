Architect Walter Craig has just arrived at Pilgrim's Farm in the Kent countryside for the weekend on the invitation of its owner, Eliot Foley, who, on reputation, wants to hire him for a renovation, Craig never having met Foley until this moment with everything up to this point having been conducted over the telephone. But for Craig, it is all a case of déjà vu as he not only has seen Foley before, but also the farmhouse, and the other guests at the farm: Foley's mother, Hugh Grainger, Sally O'Hara, Joan Cortland, and Dr. Van Straaten. He has seen them all together like they are now in this very living room in a recurring dream, he even aware that there will be a late arrival of a dark-haired young woman, which is indeed the case. But he remembers little beyond this scant outline as the dream is always a fleeting thought after he awakens until he dreams it again. For some understanding of what is happening, Craig turns primarily to Van Straaten, who he is aware from his dream is a psychiatrist before Van Straaten divulges it himself. Because of the supernatural nature of the situation and wanting the doctor's take, Grainger, O'Hara and Cortland go on to tell stories in which they were directly involved which had a similar supernatural element of an evil and/or deathly nature, that death sometimes for they themselves. Even before Foley and Van Straaten proceed to tell similar stories of their own of which they were peripherally involved, Craig believes that danger awaits him if he stays. Van Straaten is able to convince him to face his fears for reality to play out, dream or no dream, instead of running away. Will Craig live to see the answers if they indeed are forthcoming?—Huggo

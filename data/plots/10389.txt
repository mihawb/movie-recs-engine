In Hong Kong, the eighteen years old Wong Kar Mun has been blind since she was two years old. She submits to a surgery of cornea transplantation, and while recovering from the operation, she realizes that she is seeing dead people. With the support of Dr. Wah, Mun tries to find who was the donor of her eyes and resolve the mystery of her visions.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

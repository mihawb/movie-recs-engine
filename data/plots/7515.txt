Syd (Chris Evans) is a stressed out coke-head who goes to a going away party for his ex-girlfriend, London (Jessica Biel) without being invited. Before the party, he meets up with Bateman (Jason Statham), a banker who brings cocaine to the party. Bateman is an impotent man who has had his share of life troubles. The movie consists of Syd, who locks himself in the bathroom, and remembers his life while dating London for over two years. At the end of the party, Syd finally confronts London and they leave together, to have sex for one last time. They wake up barely in time to make the airport the next morning. Just when one believes they will get back together, London walks to her gate. Syd is seen driving away, though London does promise she will see him again.

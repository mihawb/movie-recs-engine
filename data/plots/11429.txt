After thirteen years in a prison ruled by a very mean director, Dr. Herbert West is invited to be the assistant of newcomer Dr. Howard Phillips, a brilliant resident, in the penitentiary infirmary. After being introduced to each other, Dr. Phillips discloses that the last experiment of Dr. West killed his sister thirteen years ago, when he was a boy, and he became fascinated with the possibility of bringing dead people back to life. The journalist Laura Olney, covering a matter for her newspaper in the prison, has an affair with Dr. Phillips and they fall in love. However, the experience of Dr. West loses control and the place becomes a branch of Hell.â€”Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

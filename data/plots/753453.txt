Five new chapters expand the VHS saga, featuring a new set of horror filmmakers. Starting with "Holy Hell", an armed-to-the-teeth SWAT team storms into a dilapidated warehouse complex and unearths disturbing scenes of sacrifice and the evildoing of an underground snuff/fetish film cult. Then, in "Storm Drain", intrigued by an urban legend, an ambitious TV news reporter and her cameraman enter the city's labyrinthine sewer system looking for a mysterious creature living in the shadows. Next, in "The Empty Wake", a young funeral home attendant oversees an overnight wake for a man who met a horrible end, and strange things happen. Following, in "The Subject", a demented prosthetics genius performing unethical experiments on living tissue attempts to perfect his biomechanical magnum opus. Finally, in "Terror", members of the First Patriots Movement Militia plan to carry out a terrorist attack in Detroit, Michigan, using an incendiary secret weapon of pure evil.â€”Nick Riganas

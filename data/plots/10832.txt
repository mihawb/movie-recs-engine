Somewhere in Romania; Clementine is finishing her day of teaching the local kids French. On her way home she spots an abandoned vehicle beside the road. She continues on unaware of what happened to its occupants, a mother and her teenage daughter, the night before. Not that it matters, as tonight, along with her writer beau Lucas, she'll find out first hand. They're awakened during the night by strange phone calls and the TV downstairs being turned on--but this is only beginning of their night of terror as the phone lines go dead, the power goes out and their car goes missing, as they're stalked and set upon by THEM!â€”Anonymous

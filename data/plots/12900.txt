It is Nazi Germany, 1942. The Russian Front has bogged down in snow and mud, and the Americans have entered the war. For the first time, defeat is a possibility. In light of this, fifteen high-ranking members from all areas of the Nazi government, soldiers, economists, administrators and lawyers, are brought together by order of Der Führer in a luxurious mansion in Wansee, Berlin. No records of their meeting will be kept, and they will not reveal the substance of their discussion to the outside world. The issue before them is to determine a solution, a "Final Solution", to the "Jewish problem", and their solution will lead to one of the most horrific and shameful episodes in human history.—Scott

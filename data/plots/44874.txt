Barbie and her cute French poodle, Sequin, embark on a fashion adventure in cosmopolitan Paris, to pay a visit to Aunt Millicent--the owner of a glamorous designer house. However, much to Barbie's dismay, business is slow, and only with the help of her aunt's timid assistant, Alice, and the magical creatures called, the "flairies", will she be able to save the fashion house. Under those circumstances, the girls need a bold idea. Will they believe in themselves to save the company?â€”Nick Riganas

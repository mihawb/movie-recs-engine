Substance-addicted Hollywood actress Suzanne Vale is on the skids. After a spell at a detox center her film company insists, as a condition of continuing to employ her, that she live with her mother, Doris Mann, who was once a star and now a champion drinker. Such a set-up is bad news for her as she has struggled for years to get out of Doris' shadow, who still treats her like a child. Despite these problems and further ones involving the men in in her life, she can begin to see the funny side of her situation, and it also starts to occur to her that not only do daughters have mothers, mothers do too.â€”Jeremy Perkins {J-26}

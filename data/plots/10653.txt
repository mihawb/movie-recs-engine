After sending his wife and son to Maine to escape the sweltering summer heat of New York City, 38-year old Richard Sherman meets a 22-year-old blonde television commercial spokesmodel, who is renting the apartment directly above him. Despite recent paranoia about becoming unfaithful (he is reading a book his company is going to publish about a "7-Year Itch"; which claims a significant proportion of men have extra-marital affairs after seven years of marriage) Richard invites the girl for a drink after she accidetnly knocks over a tomato plant from the balcony above and almost hits him. He fantasizes in hilarious scenes of himself seducing the woman as well as thinking about his wife having an affair on her retreat with their neighbor.

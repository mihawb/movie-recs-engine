Tessa has everything to lose; Hardin has nothing to lose--except her. 'After We Collided'--life will never be the same. After their relationship gets off to a tumultuous beginning, Tessa and Hardin are on the path to making things work. Tessa knows Hardin can be cruel, but when a bombshell revelation is dropped about the origins of their relationship--and Hardin's mysterious past--Tessa is beside herself. Hardin will always be--Hardin. But is he really the deep, thoughtful guy Tessa fell madly in love with despite his angry exterior--or has he been a stranger all along? She wishes she could walk away. It's just not that easy. Hardin knows he made a mistake, possibly the biggest one of his life. He's not going down without a fight. But can he change? Will he change--for love? Yes. Yes, he will.â€”punkress

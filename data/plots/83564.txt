A young boy (Bambino) is in a boat named La Luna (the moon) with his father and grand father. All 3 have caps on and since the two elders wear them differently, they both place Bambino's (Bam) hat on his head to match their own. Then as a full moon rises, grandpa gives Bam an anchor and his dad pulls out a long ladder. Bam is sent up to the top with the anchor and throws it to the moon. The anchor takes him all the way to the moon's surface. Bam soon discovers that the moon's light comes from millions of small stars. As a new one lands on the moon's surface, his dad and grandpa pull themselves up to the moon. As they star to sweep the stars into a pile, a gigantic star lands, and pieces the surface. The two elders try to lift the huge star to now avail. Then, Bambino gets a small hammer and climbs to the top of the star and taps it. Suddenly the big star breaks up into little stars Bambino lands safely. All three get to work and finish sweeping the stars into a pile and the return to the boat. Before they row away, Bambino is praised by both for his innovation. As the boat rows back to their home, a bright crescent moon is shown in the sky above.

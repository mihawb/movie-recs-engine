The film following the light novel series by the same name picks up on volume 6 (The TV series leaves off on the end of volume 3, but the story in Volume 6 doesn't reference the events of Volume 4 or 5, which have yet to be animated) The "One True God" Tet tells the story of Immanity's (humanity's) struggle through the Great War and how he came to be the "One True God". The lack of magic circuits in the Imannity race becomes apparent when details of the war fall into place. The true power of intellect is shown in this epic arc which acts as the prequel to the No Game, No Life universe.â€”DSiren

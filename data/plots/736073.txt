In retaliation, Falcone hires San Ho Hui Triad member, Mickey Chen, to bomb Dent's house. Both Dent and his wife Gilda survive, but Dent is hospitalized.Batman chases Chen down to the sewers, where Chen runs into Solomon Grundy. Batman convinces Grundy to spare Chen and takes Chen to the GCPD. Lacking evidence of his involvement in the bombing, Batman and Gordon are forced to release him.

After Chen and his associates are killed by Viti's murderer, Gordon and Batman question Calendar Man in Arkham Asylum on the identity of the murderer, who is now coined "Holiday." Calendar Man names Falcone, Sal Maroni, and Dent all as suspects. He then says that Batman's war on crime is a "joke," and Batman realizes the Joker has escaped from Arkham.Not wanting Holiday to replace him as Gotham's most notorious criminal, Joker confronts Dent in his home and threatens to kill Gilda if Dent is proven to be Holiday. Maroni advises Batman that if Joker is Holiday, he will inevitably target Falcone himself. On Christmas Eve, Joker harasses Falcone, warning him to divulge any new information about Holiday to him.

After Batman foils Joker, he returns to the yacht and accuses Alberto of being Holiday, targeting his father's associates to gain power within the family.

The latter had previously rejected Alberto's fianc√©e from Oxford.As the New Year hits, Alberto is shot by Holiday and falls into the bay, where he is cut to pieces by the propellers. Batman pursues Holiday, but Holiday escapes the yacht. As the yacht is evacuated, Gordon and Dent meet with Batman.

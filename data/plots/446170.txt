Police Commissioner Francois Visconti is investigating the disappearance of Dany Arnaud. The teenager did not return home. No one knows what happened. Familiarity with the family does not reassure the protagonist. They did not provide him with any valuable information. Seemed a bit strange. The boy's mother is an elegant woman who loves to flirt and does not fit at first glance at the role of a caring spouse, homemaker. The father turned out to be a taciturn, gloomy, angular, rude man. It is likely that if the boy's parents were different, he would not have disappeared.â€”Peter-Patrick76 (peter-patrick@mail.com)

In the early 1930s after thirty years of faithful service, Paris bank clerk Henri Verdoux is relieved of his duties due to the depression. To support his polio-stricken wife Mona and their adolescent son Peter, he decides as his next career to be self-employed by becoming a modern day Bluebeard: using a number of different aliases, woo and marry unsuspecting well-off elderly women, and when he has stripped them of their money, kill them. He has many different women on the go at any given time. He is unaware that some of those women had a past themselves, some people who are looking for their missing "loved ones". With fourteen dead wives and one other person dead as collateral damage, Verdoux may have met his match in who may be the most annoying of all his wives, the brash and loud mouthed Annabella Bonheur, a nouveau riche who came about her money by winning a lottery and who seems to be immune to his unknowing attempts to kill her. Verdoux may get a different view of life in his sporadic relationship with a down and out young woman, on who he was intending to test a new more efficient poison to use on his victims, and conversely who is continually grateful to him for his kindness to her.â€”Huggo

Via an "interview", Jimmy Rabbitte, a bit of a scammer albeit one with a heart of gold, tells the story of the Commitments, "the hardest working band in all of Dublin". The goal of the ten piece ensemble, which he founded and manages, is to perform what he calls "Dublin soul", music of the working class by the working class which indeed does touch their soul. The choice of the genre is despite all the members being white with no background at all in soul music. While Jimmy had always wanted to be in the music business in loving music, the genesis of the band was speaking to his mates Outspan Foster and Derek Scully, in their own band at the time, after watching them perform at a wedding. As manager, Jimmy was able not only to cobble together the ten musicians that form the Commitments, but is able to handle all the managerial duties to varying degrees of success. While each of the ten has his or her own reason for needing the band in their life at its inception, the question is how the interview will end, in other words if Jimmy is able to hold everything together with the different personalities within the group, some who didn't like each other from the beginning, and in dealing with the changing fortunes and attitudes of the individual members.â€”Huggo

When the head of Ong-Bak, the sacred Buddha of a poor village, is stolen, the population falls into misery. The Buddha was the focal point of an anniversary vigil believed to bring rain to the drought-stricken area. Young Ting volunteers to travel to Bangkok and retrieve the relic in time for their ceremony. Ting, trained in muay thai by monks who forbade him to use it in combat, must avoid the temptation to use it as he delves into the seedy underworld of a corrupt city.â€”austin4577@aol.com

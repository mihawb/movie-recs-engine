2010. Forced to decide whether to forgive, fight, or leave after realising someone has been abusing them at night, the traumatised mothers, wives, daughters, and sisters of a tight-knit Mennonite colony secretly assemble to vote. But with fear, religious belief, misogyny, and the grave repercussions of rebellion getting in the way of a clear decision, the terrified women find themselves left with no alternative. After all, lengthy discussions require time, the most precious commodity of all. And as tempers flare and tensions boil over, like it or not, the sisterhood will have to take action to make themselves heard.â€”Nick Riganas

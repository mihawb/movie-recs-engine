Mykola is an eccentric Ukrainian pacifist who wants to be useful to humanity. When Russia-Ukraine War begins in eastern Ukraine's region of Donbas in 2014, Mykola's naive world is collapsing as Russian soldiers kill his pregnant wife and burn his home to the ground. Recovered, he makes a cardinal decision and gets enlisted in a sniper company. Having met his wife's killers, he emotionally breaks down and arranges "sniper terror" for the Russian enemy. He's saved from a senseless death by his instructor who himself gets mortally wounded. The death of a friend leaves a "scar" and Mykola is ready to sacrifice his life.â€”intl sales agent

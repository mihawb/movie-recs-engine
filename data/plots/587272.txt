2019, City of Madrid (Madrid, center to Spain and capital's country). According to himself, Javier is the perfect father of the 21st Century: working as CEO and computer technician for an important mobile phone company, he is all the days lost in his laptop programming new apps for an incoming project, neglecting his wife Marisa and his five children (teenager Sara, preteen Carlota, child Rocío and Dani, and little child Paula) despite he believes that all is right, that he knows perfectly to his children and that Marisa simply exaggerates any thing needlessly. It despairs to the own Marisa, who nicknames Javier as a perfect "husband brother-in-law" by the way to fix any trouble in the belief that he's perfect in anything he does, at the same time that she only counts with the help of Rosaura, Marisa's house maid, to care the children. But the situation explodes when Javier gives Marisa bad news: he cannot fulfill the long-time promised travel to the Caribbean travel to celebrate their 15 years of marriage. Tired and bored of Javier, Marisa offers her sister-in-law Carmen make the travel for a week, testing Javier to prove if he's really so perfect as he thinks. While Marisa realizes her bad election and the nightmare to share the travel with a Carmen crazy to take a walk by the wild side, Javier discovers soon as his new job as father overcomes him, turning a week in theory simple and quiet in an unstoppable spiral of madness where nothing will not return to be as before.—Chockys

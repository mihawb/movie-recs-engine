A noirish crime thriller, Galveston centers on New Orleans hitman Roy Cady, whose mobster boss has decided to remove him from the business - and the world- because he fears Roy might try to get even with him for stealing his woman. Roy escapes the ambush set up for him and goes on the run with incriminating business records and rescued teenage hooker Raquel "Rocky" Arceneaux. He's tricked into picking up her 3 year old supposed sister Tiffany, and with his new wards in tow, heads to Galveston to hide out and scheme revenge and redemption.â€”Polly_Kat and Mr P

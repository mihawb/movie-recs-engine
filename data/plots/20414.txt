Carlo Verdone once again plays three characters from his comic repertoire: the naive boy, the logor teacher, and the Roman "cafone". In the first episode, Leo is desperate for his mother's sudden death, In the second episode, the striking Professor Callisto has a possessive relationship with the timid son who never had a girl and In the last story, the vulgar Moreno goes with his family of cafes in a luxury hotel in Taormina.

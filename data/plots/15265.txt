On his way to school, a young adolescent boy sees a red balloon tied to a lamppost, which he unties and takes with him. He treats it with care, much like he would another human In return, it becomes his friend. He no longer even needs to hold onto its string as it willingly follows him around. But as he was attracted to it in friendship, a gang of boys also becomes interested in it and tries to take it away from him, not all with the best of intentions. His efforts to protect it leads to his kindness being paid several times over in return.â€”Huggo

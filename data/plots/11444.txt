François Pignon (Daniel Auteuil) is a non-entity accountant, divorced two years but still in love with his wife and wanting a better relationship with their 17 y/o son. Then, he is the last in his company to hear that he is to be fired. A neighbour suggests that Pignon creates the impression that he is gay, so that the company executives will find it difficult to fire him or else be thought homophobic. The plan works. Meanwhile, Félix Santini (Gérard Depardieu) is convinced, by joking fellow-executives, that Santini must treat Pignon particularly well or run the risk of charges of homophobia. Santini's bumbling attempts at positive contact with Pignon make the middle of the movie somewhat silly, but Depardieu's straight-faced believability saves this part of the movie. In the end, Pignon "gets the girl" and all is well.

Not knowing what to expect, Teresa returns home for the funeral of her grandmother, Carmelita. But there, in the remote Brazilian outback, corruption rules the arid, water-deprived, and seemingly nonexistent village of Bacurau: a tight-knit community forgotten by God and even Google Maps. Then, suddenly, Bacurau becomes a pole of attraction for mysterious visitors, and an imperceptible, insidious menace casts its dark shadow over the small settlement. Now, as cell phone service disappears and an unexpected object observes from afar, a string of strange occurrences alarms the pill-popping inhabitants. Is death rapidly approaching?â€”Nick Riganas

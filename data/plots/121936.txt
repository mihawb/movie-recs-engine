Sacha loves his friends, his piano and partying. At night, he plays in a jazz club and seduces pretty girls. He lives for the moment, looking for pleasure. No alarm clock, no engagement, no taxes. Charlotte has three kids, two ex-husbands and a thriving professional life. She has no room for a love story. They have nothing in common. They shouldn't be together... They're made for one another.â€”Happy_Evil_Dude

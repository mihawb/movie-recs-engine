Lewis Thomas, a college student, decides to go on a cross-country trip to pick up his girlfriend, Venna. On his way there, he picks up his older brother, Fuller, from jail. Fuller, looking for a good time, decides to tag along with his brother. During the trip, Fuller also decides to play a prank on a guy, only known as Rusty Nail, through his CB radio and convinces Lewis to do it with him. At first, it seemed like fun. But not soon after, the joke goes too far. Pretty soon, Lewis, Fuller, and Venna find themselves in danger when a psychopathic truck driver would constantly follow them on their tails and would stop at nothing just to see them dead.â€”Chris Wang {Magicalprinceofthieves@yahoo.com}

A story of deep love. A story of trust, courage, pain, despair, and the strength to let go. A true story. Jessica has an uncomplicated life and a promising future. Leaving the house one evening, she has no idea that she's about to meet the love of her life - and that her entire understanding of the world is about to change. Before long, she's going to face a decision that will shape her forever.â€”katharinereinktran

2020, City of Madrid (Madrid, center to Spain and country's capital). After the success of virtual assistant Conchy created by him, the life of Javier and Marisa with their five children (teenager Sara, preteen Carlota, child Rocío and Dani, and little child Paula) seems to be better than ever. However, troubles appear by surprise in an unstoppable way: Carmen leaves Paco (Javier's brother) by his negative to have a child; Marisa's maid Rosaura announces to leave the family after Marisa's friend Leticia tempted her in secret to work for her in better job conditions; Sara is interested in a high school classmate named Junior; Rocío becomes obsessive to be Andalucian to be a star of flamenco music; Dani just want for traveling Eurodisney and has troubles with his school coach who prevents him to play soccer; and Paula passes the days claiming to have a pet dog. As if it not was enough, Marisa gives Javier a special news: she's pregnant...again. Overwhelmed by the situation despite all his efforts, Javier tries to keep together his highly dysfunctional family, but with disastrous results: after a strong discussion with the school coach Javier replaces him in the job just to learn that Dani is a dreadful soccer player; Rocío escapes from home trying to travel Sevilla to be a Andalusian girl; and Sara is shamed by his father and relatives during a school camping when Javier moves there with the other children to spy Sara, fearing that she and Junior have relations. Distressed beyond the reasonable and tired of the excessive attentions of Javier to her by the pregnancy, Marisa fulfills her longtime threat: she calls Milagros to help the family. A strong woman that loves Marisa but despises Javier, the grandmother of the family is a force of nature who appears as a twister in the house, turning Javier's life in a hell. According time passes, Javier and Milagros enter in an open war to be head of the family, specially when Rocío's First Communion is incoming and the two compete fiercely to give her an unforgettable day.—Chockys
